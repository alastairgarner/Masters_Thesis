## Sensory circuitry for escape behaviour

The class IV dendrite arborization (CIVda or MDIV) neurons are the primary nociceptive neurons in larvae and they tile the larval body wall[@Grueber2002,@Tracey2003]. Tracey *et al.* first implicated these neurons in nociception by identification of mutants for the gene *painless* (expressed in CIVda neurons) that fail to demonstrate nocifensive behaviour in response to thermal or mechanical nociceptive stimuli[@Tracey2003]. The same group later showed CIVda neurons to be both necessary and sufficient for triggering rolling behaviour, using a complement of neuronal activation and inhibition.

A number of papers have begun to elucidate the second-order sensory neurons, downstream of CIVda neurons, that are also implicated in escape behaviours. One of the keys to these findings was the generation of a serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) volume for the brain of a first instar larva[@Ohyama2015]. This dataset has allowed for reconstruction of individual neurons, as well as mapping the number of synaptic connections between pairs of neurons. In total 14 distinct pairs of neurons have been identified as receiving monosynaptic connections from the CIVda nociceptive neurons[@Gerhard2017]. At present, 8 pairs of these neurons have been shown to elicit escape behaviour when activated, including the Basin(A09a,c)[@Ohyama2015], DnB (A09l)[@Burgos2018], mCSI (A02m/n)[@Yoshino2017], Wave (A02o)[@Takagi2017], A08n and SeIN138[@Hu2017].

The majority of these escape-sufficient neurons make local projections within the ventral nerve cord (VNC). Of these, Ohyama *et al.*[@Ohyama2015] identified 4 pairs of segmentally repeated neurons, termed Basin neurons, which received input from both CIVda and vibration-detecting chordotonal (Ch) neurons. Imaging these neurons illustrated they were functionally multisensory and that activation of Ch neurons using a vibration stimulus affected a multimodal enhancement on rolling behaviour. Additionally they identified a single neuron pair, termed Goro, that received convergent pathways from Basin neurons, which was also sufficient to elicit rolling behaviour.

Another key target of CIVda neurons are the pair of A09l neurons[@Burgos2018], coined 'Down-and-Back' (DnB) neurons, which have also been linked to the Goro-mediated roll pathway. Like Basin neurons, A09l neurons are multisensory, receiving monosynaptic input from both CIVda and gentle-touch receptor neurons, CIIda and CIIIda, as well as sufficient to trigger escape behaviours.

Interestingly, the neurons discovered thus far are differentially implicated in specific elements of the escape repertoire. For instance, activation of Goro triggers C-bending and rolling, but not fast-crawling behaviour[@Ohyama2015]. There is also evidence that C-bending and rolling may be separable, given that the combination of A09l activation and Goro silencing reduces presentation of rolling, but not C-bending[@Burgos2018]. Similarly SeIN138 neurons, termed dorsal pair of insulin-like peptide 7 producing neurons (DP-ilp7), specifically trigger bending behaviour akin to the initial C-shape bend performed prior to rolling.

It is yet unclear to what extent each of these neurons is important for specific modes within the behavioural repertoire



## Larval musculature

The somatic musculature of *Drosophila* larvae is highly stereotyped and well described[@Bate1990]. Each abdominal hemisegment contains 30 muscles that can broadly be categorised by two groups: the longitudinal muscles which arrange in parallel with the body axis, or the transverse muscles which are circumferential to the body wall[@Bate1990,@Clark2018a] ([@fig:muscles]). Each of these 30 muscles are innervated by a single "big" bouton motor neuron (1b motor neurons), as well as a single "small" bouton (1s motor neuron) neuron that projects to each of the muscles within one of three anatomically related groups (dorsal longitudinal, ventral longitudinal and transverse)[@Landgraf2006,@Peron2009]. These motor neurons provide glutamatergic, excitatory innervation of the muscles. The 1b neurons show rhythmic activity coincident with waves of muscle contraction during both forward and backward locomotion[@Newman2017].

## Motor cohorts vary by behaviour

The anatomical grouping of muscles also allude to potential functional grouping. In fact, functionally co-active cohorts of muscles have previously been identified for crawling behaviours. In describing the motor profile for peristaltic crawling, Heckscher *et al*. identified that longitudinal muscles (both ventral and dorsal) contracted prior to transverse muscles during posterior to anterior waves of contraction[@Heckscher2012].  This suggested that their was separable premotor circuitry controlling the activity of these different function muscle cohorts.

A more recent study employed calcium imaging to measure the activation of somatic muscles during both forward and reverse crawls[@Zarin2019a]. Interestingly, this allowed them to recognise that the functional grouping of muscles between these two behaviours differed. As such, there must be some degree of unique premotor circuitry which is specifically recruited for either behavioural mode[@Zarin2019a].

No studies as of yet have addressed which cohorts of muscles are active during, or necessary for nocifensive C-bend or rolling behaviour. Though this seems likely given the motion propagates in parallel with the anteroposterior axis during crawling, while propagation is circumferential to it during rolling. As such, it will be interesting to determine which premotor neurons are responsible for motor cohort recruitment and whether these premotor neurons are uniquely implicated in the performance of escape behaviours.

Thus one of our key questions is whether escape behaviours require distinct co-active muscle cohorts from crawling behaviours (**answered by our data**). 

## Motor cohorts for escape behaviours

Both C-bending behaviour and rolling behaviour are distinct from crawling behaviour for displaying asymmetric posture[@Tracey2003]. While no motor cohorts have been directly associated with these escape behaviours, there is some evidence implicating particular PMNs, and therefore also motor neurons, in the performance of other asymmetric behaviours.

Picao-Osorio *et al*.[@Picao-Osorio2015] screened for neurons implicated in self-righting behaviour, in which upside-down larvae must correct their dorsoventral orientation. This behaviour includes left-right bending of the larva followed by a 180&deg;Â rotation, abridged but visually similar to a full 360&deg;nocifensive roll. They identified a population of LT motor neurons, so-named as they project to the lateral transverse muscles ([@fig:muscles]). Silencing these LT neurons impaired the ability of larvae to roll back onto their ventral side. 

The LT neurons were more conclusively implicated in escape behaviours by Yoshino *et al.*, who found that silencing LT neurons (LT-1,2,3,4, [@fig:muscles]) reduced the percentage of animals that performed a roll[@Yoshino2017]. Notably, these same motor neurons have been shown to be anatomically downstream of the Down-and-Back neuron (A09l)[@Burgos2018], as well as functionally downstream of the mCSIs[@Yoshino2017] - both of which are sufficient to elicit nocifensive behaviour. How these muscle neurons are necessary for performance of rolling is yet undetermined.

Identification of other premotor neurons associated with left-right asymmetric posture came from Heckscher *et al*.[@Heckscher2015], who discovered a set of 5 premotor neurons expressing the Even-skipped (Eve) transcription factor, Eve Lateral (EL). Activation or silencing of EL neurons caused a asymmetric gait during crawling. TEM tracing of EL neurons revealed direct excitatory innervation of motor neurons (U1,U2 & RP2) projecting to contralateral longitudinal muscles ([@fig:muscles]). Further, ELs formed disynaptic connections with, via the inhibitory Saaghi-1,3 premotor neurons, with motor neurons innervating ipsilateral longitudinal muscles. These results suggested that asymmetric activation of longitudinal muscles was sufficient to produce asymmetric postures.



## Premotor circuits coordinate motor recruitment 

Zwart2016, Kohsaka2019

While premotor neurons recruit specific muscle groups, the performance of behaviour requires the coordinated temporal activation of different motor cohorts. Other premotor neurons have been implicated in this coordination. 

One example of such coordination is the aforementioned phase delay between longitudinal and transverse muscles during forward crawling. To identify potential candidate neurons encoding this delay, Zwart *et al*.[@Zwart2016] performed TEM reconstruction of the PMNs upstream of motor neurons innervating the lateral transverse muscles ([@fig:muscles]). They identified a single inhibitory GABAergic premotor neuron (iIN-1) that was exclusively upstream of LT muscles. Silencing iIN-1 resulted in simultaneous contraction of longitudinal and transverse muscle during peristalsis, suggesting that it was sufficient to mediate the phase delay between longitudinal and transverse muscles.

Feed-forward inhibition

While iIN-1 coordinates motor cohorts within a single abdominal segment, neurons implementing a similar 

Kohsaka *et al.* described two neurons, Ifb-Fwd and Ifb-Bwd, that also contribute to antagonism between longitudinal and transverse muscle activation[@Kohsaka2019]. During forward waves of peristalsis Ifb-Fwd fed back



Feedback-inhibition of antagonistic muscle.



## A premotor connectome

Zarin *et al*.[@Zarin2019a] undertook the mammoth effort of reconstructing all 60 MNs and 236 PMNs in a single TEM segment of the larval nervous system. With this they sought to answer how a common population of muscles could generate two distinct behavioural programs, that of forward and backward crawling. Using calcium imaging of patterns of pan-muscle activation they identified differences in the order of muscle recruitment for either behavioural mode. PMN reconstruction did not elucidate specific neurons innervating functionally distinct muscle groups for either behaviour, suggesting combinatorial coding is required to recruit behaviour-specific functional muscle groups. Further, they developed a recurrent network model of PMN and MN neurons across two segments, constrained by the measured connectivity, and demonstrated that the patterns of connectivity in this motor network was sufficient to elicit comparable patterns of muscle contraction for both forward and backward peristalsis. The model was successfully validated on known PMN activity for A14a, A18j, A01c (iIN-1,eIN-1,eIN-2) [@Zwart2016] and A18a[@Hasegawa2016], as well as recordings from novel PMNs (A31k, A06l and A23a)[@Zarin2019a]. This work will prove invaluable for future research, allowing phenotypic and functional studies to be grounded in terms of anatomic connectivity.
