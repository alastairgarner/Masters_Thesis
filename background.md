Sensory circuits for nocifensive behaviour

- CIVda's necessary for escape behaviour [@Trcaey2003]
- 13 second-order sensory neurons (first order interneurons) - Gerhard
- Of these, X number are known to be sufficient for escape behaviours
- Basins
  - include ELs and Goro
- A09l
- mCSI - (A02m,A02n)
- A08n
- DP-ilp7
- None have been shown to be necessary, suggesting redundancy

Musculature

- Musculature only
- 

Motor cohorts for escape behaviour

- Do not have a motor profile for escape - can only infer from observation
  - Don't know how they generate (compared to piston in crawling)
- C-bend - asymmetric posture
- Roll - rotation
- 

Motor cohorts for other behaviour

- distinction between longitudinal and transverse - generally how muscles can be segregated (functional vs anatomical groups)
- Heckscher - described motor profile
  - Zwart - neural substrate for this delay
- Zarin - greater discrimination of functional groups
  - Zarin - circuit model to test neurons
- Mention briefly other cohort coordination neurons
  - Fushiki
  -  

Tracing

- Zarin
- Great tool, but unable to apply to nocifensive behaviour until motor profile for escape known

## Sensory circuitry for escape behaviour

The class IV dendrite arborization (CIVda or MDIV) neurons are the primary nociceptive neurons in larvae and they tile the larval body wall[@Grueber2002,@Tracey2003]. Tracey *et al.* first implicated these neurons in nociception by identification of mutants for the gene *painless* (expressed in CIVda neurons) that fail to demonstrate nocifensive behaviour in response to thermal or mechanical nociceptive stimuli[@Tracey2003]. The same group later showed CIVda neurons to be both necessary and sufficient for triggering rolling behaviour, using a complement of neuronal activation and inhibition.

A number of papers have begun to elucidate the second-order sensory neurons, downstream of CIVda neurons, that are also implicated in escape behaviours. One of the keys to these findings was the generation of a serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) volume for the brain of a first instar larva[@Ohyama2015]. This dataset has allowed for reconstruction of individual neurons, as well as mapping the number of synaptic connections between pairs of neurons. In total 14 distinct pairs of neurons have been identified as receiving monosynaptic connections from the CIVda nociceptive neurons[@Gerhard2017]. At present, 8 pairs of these neurons have been shown to elicit escape behaviour when activated, including the Basin(A09a,c)[@Ohyama2015], DnB (A09l)[@Burgos2018], mCSI (A02m/n)[@Yoshino2017], Wave (A02o)[@Takagi2017], A08n and SeIN138[@Hu2017].

The majority of these escape-sufficient neurons make local projections within the ventral nerve cord (VNC). Of these, Ohyama *et al.*[@Ohyama2015] identified 4 pairs of segmentally repeated neurons, termed Basin neurons, which received input from both CIVda and chordotonal (Ch) neurons. Imaging these neurons illustrated they were functionally multisensory and that activation of Ch neurons using a vibration stimulus affected a multimodal enhancement on rolling behaviour. Additionally they identified a single neuron pair, termed Goro, that received convergent pathways from Basin neurons, which was also sufficient to elicit rolling behaviour.

Another key target of CIVda neurons are the pair of A09l neurons[@Burgos2018], coined 'Down-and-Back' (DnB) neurons, which have also been linked to the Goro-mediated roll pathway. Like Basin neurons, A09l neurons are multisensory, receiving monosynaptic input from both CIVda and gentle-touch receptor neurons, CIIda and CIIIda, as well as sufficient to trigger escape behaviours.

Interestingly, the neurons discovered thus far are differentially implicated in specific elements of the escape repertoire. For instance, activation of Goro triggers C-bending and rolling, but not fast-crawling behaviour[@Ohyama2015]. There is also evidence that C-bending and rolling may be separable, given that the combination of A09l activation and Goro silencing reduces presentation of rolling, but not C-bending[@Burgos2018]. Similarly SeIN138 neurons, termed dorsal pair of insulin-like peptide 7 producing neurons (DP-ilp7), specifically trigger bending behaviour akin to the initial C-shape bend performed prior to rolling.

It is yet unclear to what extent each of these neurons is important for specific modes within the behavioural repertoire



Goro - no fast crawl

A09l minus Goro, no roll, still C-bend

Wave - tail flick



Introduce key players - Basin and A09l

Explain overlap in circuitry

Explain activation of distinct motions by different players

- Roll
- Unknown how they do this
