## Behavioural apparatus

We employed a custom rig for conducting behavioural experiments, of similar design to that in previous publications [@Ohyama2013,@Ohyama2015]. The stage was illuminated by infrared light and recorded by a top-mounted camera (FLIR, 30fps, 2048x2048 resolution). LED under-lighting (624nm) was used for optogenetic stimulation. Recordings were controlled through the Multi-worm Tracker (MWT) software [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mwt](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mwt) [@Swierczek2011] whilst control of the hardware module was controlled through the Stimulus Control Module (SCM) software. Objects detected in MWT are saved as contours. 



## Behavioural experiments

Embryos were collected for 24 hours at 25&deg;C. Foraging third instar larvae were used for all experiments. Larvae were raised in the dark at 25&deg;C for 3-4 days on fly food containing *trans*-retinal (Sigma, R2500) at a concentration of 500&mu;M.

Before the experiments the larvae were separated from food by suspension in 15% sucrose and with water. Larvae were dried then transferred to the centre of a 25x25 cm transparent plastic, square plate covered in a layer of 2% agar gel. Up to 80 larvae were transferred to the plate for any given recording. When using strains containing *UAS-CsChrimson* larval collection and experiments were run under IR light. 



## Behavioural analysis
### Choreography

Behavioural recordings were captured with the Multi-worm Tracker (MWT) software [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mwt](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mwt) [@Swierczek2011]. Raw videos were never saved, due to their large file size. Instead MWT outputs text files with the spine and contour for each object tracked at a refresh rate of approximately 30fps. Objects that were tracked for fewer than 5 seconds, or travelled less than one body length in distance were rejected. Objects with an average area < 2.5mm^2^ were rejected to exclude larvae younger than third instar stage. From this tracking data we were able to compute key parameters of larval motion using the Choreography program (packaged with MWT) [@Swierczek2011], including generating the spine of the object, curve, speed and crabspeed.



### LARA/Salam/Feature Extraction

To detect the performance of discrete rolling and crawling events we used the LARA software package [https://sourceforge.net/projects/salam-hhmi/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/salam-hhmi/) [@Ohyama2013]. LARA takes, as its input, variables generated by Choreography (described above), using crabspeed for detection of rolling and speed for determining bouts of peristaltic crawling. In brief, detection of a rolling event is determined by the crabspeed value passing a set upper threshold (2.8mm/s) and persists until it drops below a lower threshold (1.8mm/s). Events are combined if they occur within 1 second of one another. A crawling run is defined as a minimum of three consecutive peaks in the speed variable, all of which must exceed a fixed threshold of 0.6mm/s, as well as exceeding 3/10 of the mean peak amplitude computed across the full duration the animal was tracked. A crawling run was broken if the gap between two consecutive good peaks was greater than 2s, or if other behaviours were detected. 



### JAABA

An alternative roll classifier was trained using the 'Janelia Automatic Animal Behavior Annotator' (JAABA) [@Kabra2013]. Training occurs via supervised learning, so requires manual labelling of roll events. For said labelling, "roll" bouts were demarcated as the frames between which larvae presented movement perpendicular to the body axis, coincident with C-shape posture (Shua Noh, unpublished).

Input files to JAABA are the outline and spine files generated from Choreography. From these files JAABA computes a suite of 'per-frame' and window features describing the locomotion, landmarks and appearance of the animal, which are used to train the classifier[@Kabra2013]. A detailed description of the pipeline can be found in [Kabra et al., 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2281) [@Kabra2013].




### JB

A final pipeline [@Masson2020], here referred to as the 'JB', was used to quantify rolling behaviour. Classifiers have already been trained for rolling behaviours and 5 other larval behaviours. Consistent with other pipelines, contour and spine files generated by Choreography are taken as input. A detailed description of the network and how it was trained can be found in [Masson et al., 2020](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008589) [@Masson2020].



### Manual Scoring

Manual scoring of escape behaviours was performed on a single timestamp of 33 larvae. Two modes of nocifensive behaviour were scored. C-shape bending was scored as a unilateral contraction of both head and tail in the same direction. These bouts were demarcated from the frame where larvae initiated the unilateral contraction to the first frame where larvae started to unfurl. A roll was scored when larvae presented C-shape posture coincident with movement > 1 body width perpendicular to the larval body axis. Roll bouts were terminated if larvae started to unfurl or lateral movement stopped.

Where C-shape bending transitioned into a roll, scoring of the C-shape bend was truncated by the first frame of perpendicular movement. Where larvae transitioned from a leftward to a rightward C-shape bend (or vice versa), bouts were appended.




## Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using custom scripts written with MATLAB 2019b (MathWorks) software. Where pairwise comparisons were performed with categorical values (e.g. did roll vs did not roll) the Fishers Exact test was conducted and p values adjusted with the Bonferroni correction. Confidence intervals were calculated as,
$$
CI = p \pm 1.96\times\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{N}}
$$
where *p* is the proportion successful outcomes (did roll). The effect size was calculated using the Odds Ratio, built into the *fishertest* function in MATLAB.

Where pairwise comparisons were performed with continuous data (e.g. roll percentage, curvature in degrees) we conducted the Wilcoxon rank rum test (Mann-Whitney U test) and adjusted p values with the Bonferroni correction. If all possible comparisons were assessed we instead performed the Kruskal-Wallis test and adjusted p values with the Dunn-Sidak correction. In either case, confidence intervals were defined as the order statistics, *Y~i~* and *Y~j~*, between which the binomial c.d.f equals .95,


$$
.95 \approx P(Y_i < m < Y_j) \approx\sum^{j-1}_{k=i} \binom{n}{k}(0.5)^k(0.5)^{n-k}
$$
where $j = (n+1)-i$ (outlined [here](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat414/node/316/)). The effect size was calculated as,
$$
r = \frac{Z}{\sqrt{N_{Obs}}}
$$
where $Z$ values calculated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and $N_{Obs}$ are the number of observations used in calculating said $Z$ statistic [@Tomczak2014]. Effect sizes were deemed to be small, .1 < *r* < .3, medium, .3 < *r* < .5, or large, .5 < *r*, based on Cohen, 1992 [@Cohen1992].

For calculations of latency to crabspeed and curve we applied the *findpeaks* function to the frame-to-frame difference for a given metric, stipulating a minimum prominence threshold of 0.4 or 2, respectively. These thresholds were chosen as they were infrequently surpassed in the absence of nocifensive behaviours. 

Code for the generation of figures and statistical analyses will be made available at [https://github.com/alastairgarner/JAABA_featExtract](https://github.com/alastairgarner/JAABA_featExtract).




## Immunohistochemistry

The following primary antibodies were used: chicken anti-GFP (1:25, supplier) and rabbit anti-dsRed (1:25, supplier). For secondary antibodies we used Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-chicken (1:250, supplier) and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anto-rabbit (1:250, supplier).

The protocols used are identical to those listed on the FlyLight website ([https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flylight/protocols](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flylight/protocols)). The CNS of third instar larvae were dissected in cold 4% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) then transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, supplier) on ice until starting a timed fixation. Samples were fixed in fresh 4% PFA at room tempereature for 1 hour then underwent four 15 minute washes in 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBT) in PBS. Samples were preblocked with 4% normal goat serum (NGS) for 2 hours at room temperature. Samples were then incubated with primary antibodies in 0.4% PBT for 4 hours at room temperature, then transferred to 4&deg;C for 2 nights. Following four 15 minute washes in 0.4% PBT, the samples were incubated with secondary antibodies in 0.4% PBT for 4 hours at room temperature, then continued incubation at 4&deg;C for two overnights. The samples were washed a final four times for 15 minutes in 0.4% PBT before being mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (supplier). Images were taken with a *Zeiss* Axio Imager fluorescence microscope.



# Results

## Aim 1.1

To elucidate possible candidates for neurons involved in nocifensive rolling behaviour we designed an optogenetic behavioural screen to determine the functional relevance of discrete neuron populations in rolling behaviour. We selected 135 driver lines with expression patterns in the ventral nerve cord from the catalogue of split-GAL4 lines maintained by the Fly Light database [@Pfeiffer2010,@Jenett2012,@Li2014]. To identify if the neuron populations labelled by these lines are involved in nocifensive behaviour we performed optogenetic co-activation of these neurons with Basin neurons [@Ohyama2015], providing two 15 second bouts of red light with a 30 second interval between bouts. We hypothesised that activation of neuron populations incorporated in the nocifensive circuitry might show changes to the likelihood, amplitude and duration of rolling. 

We compared rolling in the different split-GAL4 lines to a driver control (*attp2;Basin-GAL4,UAS-CsChrimson*) that exclusively activates escape behaviours and evaluated rolling based on the metrics generated by the Salam pipeline for scoring behaviour [@Ohyama2013]. For each split-GAL4 line (which we will refer to by the last four digits in their name) tested we achieved 50 < *n* < 250 animals across an average of 4 replications over multiple days. Lines where fewer than 50 animals were tested were ignored. For statistical analysis experiments were only compared to those controls performed on the same-day to account for day-to-day variance. Some figures are normalised by control values, such that the resultant metric is the difference ($\Delta$) between the experimental and same-day control. In order to simplify the discussion of significant results we decided to group lines based on similarities in phenotype across the different metrics analysed.

### Identification of phenotypically similar split-GAL4 lines

If the neuron populations being tested were important or necessary for rolling behaviour, we expected that we might see changes to the incidence of rolling. At an irradiance of 600&mu;W/cm^2^ stimulation reliably induced rolling in 90% of control animals per-trial ([@fig:A1_1]A). None of the lines tested showed a significant decrease in roll probability. Interestingly, despite the high baseline of roll proportion in controls we did observe several lines that showed an increase in roll proportion ([@fig:A1_1]A). We note that other lines that increase roll proportion may have been occluded, given said high baseline.

Given the roll proportion was high for most genotypes, to assess changes in the presentation of rolling behaviour we quantified the average time spent rolling per larvae. We observed that 39 of the lines tested showed a significant increase in the time spent rolling, while 5 showed a significant decrease ([@fig:A1_1]B). Further we found many lines showed statistically significant increases and decreases in the number of rolls per animal ([@fig:supp1]B) and the average amplitude of rolls per animal ([@fig:supp1]C), where the amplitude of a roll is defined as the maximum crabspeed during a bout of rolling.

Analysis of roll-specific metrics are limited in that they can only give insight to the specific bouts of time classified as "rolls". As such, lower-level features describing the posture and movement of the larvae can give more general insight into subtler changes in escape behaviour. Of these, high curvature along the "spine" (midline from head to tail) of larvae is indicative of C-bending behaviour, while its co-presentation with increased crabspeed (movement perpendicular to the body axis) is indicative of rolling behaviour. Changes in average crabspeed were generally co-presented with changes in average roll duration, particularly for groups 2 and 3 ([@fig:A1_1]B,C). Notably the change in average curvature of the animals does not co-present with increased rolling duration, as group 1 showed significantly decreased curvature during the bout of stimulation, while group 2 show a significant increase ([@fig:A1_1]D).

### Changes in rolling vary independently of curvature and crabspeed

Given an abundance of significant results (likely inflated due to high statistical power, 50 < *n* < 250), we chose to parse our data to find groups of split-GAL4 lines with similar phenotypes. To do this we visualised the aforementioned metrics over the time series of the experiment, allowing us to analyse modulation of escape behaviours at higher temporal resolution. 

Lines presenting with increased roll proportions could be split into two groups. The first presented with a delayed but increased peak in roll percentage 2 seconds after the onset of stimulation ([@fig:A1_2]A). Roll percentage steadily decreased, yet remained higher than the control, throughout the remainder of stimulation. While *1816* showed a significant increase in crabspeed during stimulation, *p* < 0.001, *r* = .285 ([@fig:A1_2]E), the temporal profile of crabspeed showed only a marginal increase, limited to the first 5 seconds of stimulation ([@fig:A1_2]B). Notably both *1816* and *1817* demonstrated a marked decrease in curve during stimulation, (*1816*) *p* < .001, *r* = .559 and (*1817*) *p* < .001, *r* = .531 ([@fig:A1_2]C,F).

The second group (*0666, 1750, 4052, 4232*) showed a strong biphasic response with an initial spike in roll percentage within 1 second of stimulation, followed by a delayed and prolonged increase in roll percentage after ~5 seconds ([@fig:A1_2]G). All of these lines co-presented with a marked increase in crabspeed during the stimulation bout, (*0666*) *p* < .001, *r* = .626, (*1750*) *p* < .001, *r* = .347, (*4052*) *p* < .001, *r* = .642 and (*4232*) *p* < .001, *r* = .607 ([@fig:A1_2]H,K). These lines showed a temporal profile in curve similar to that of the control ([@fig:A1_2]H), though this was significant when averaged across the stimulation bout for *0666*, *p* < .001, *r* = .284 and *4232*, *p* < .001, *r* = .487.

Thus, increases in roll duration can independently vary with larval curvature or crabspeed. For group 1, the large effect of decreased curvature suggests a potential decrease in the presentation of C-shape bending behaviour. Whereas a large effect of increased crabspeed for group 2 suggests that either larvae spend more time moving perpendicular to their body axis, or that they do this with a greater amplitude than control animals.



### Interneurons reducing performance of escape behaviour

Another group of lines (*1951*, *4245*, *4189*) presented a decrease in roll percentage during the late phase of the stimulation bout ([@fig:A1_3a]A), but the average decrease in roll duration across the stimulation bout was only significant for *1951*, *p* = .007, *r* = .347 ([@fig:A1_3a]D). This was complemented by a decrease in both the curve and the crabspeed of the larvae throughout the course of stimulation ([@fig:A1_3a]B,C,E,F). We note that the percentage of animals rolling for our control data was higher than usual for these particular comparisons, which may have contributed to the significance of these results.

(**D**) Average time-spent rolling per larva. **E** and **F** show the values of **B** and **C**, respectively, averaged across the duration of stimulation. Horizontal orange bar, stimulation bout.

The final line of interest, *4248*, displayed no obvious phenotype for rolling behaviour ([@fig:A1_3b]B,E) or for presentation of crabspeed ([@fig:A1_3b]C,F). However, activation of escape behaviours by Basin neurons typically results in a post-stimulation increase in crawl speed, referred to a 'fast-crawling'. Co-activation with *4248* eliminated this increase in crawl speed ([@fig:A1_3b]A) such that post-stimulation crawl speed was significantly lower, *p* < .001, *r* = .602, than its driver control ([@fig:A1_3b]D).

## Aim 2.1

Having identified 4 different groups of neurons modulating unique aspects of nocifensive behaviour we choose to focus on the 2 groups showing the strongest phenotypic modulation (group 1 & 2). We selected one line from each group (*1816* & *4232*, respectively) for follow up, as they showed the most consistent phenotypic change on repeated trials. 

Split-GAL4 line *1816* drives expression selectively in a pair of segmentally repeated neurons in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) of the larval nervous system ([@fig:A2_1]A). These neurons have previously been identified as the A02e neurons, part of a family of lineage-related period-positive median segmental interneurons (PMSI) population (includes neurons A02a-k) [@Kohsaka2014]. They are reported to be GABAergic and thus inhibitory interneurons that directly innervate motor neurons [@Kohsaka2019]. Line *4232* drove expression in an unknown group of approximately 3 pairs of neurons with expression limited to the brain ([@fig:A2_1]B).

### Nocifensive curvature is inversely related with *1816* activity

The performance of escape behaviour can differ depending on the intensity with which Basin neurons are stimulated. At high intensities rolling behaviour is most prominent 5-10 seconds after the onset of stimulation, whereas at lower intensities rolling is most prominent during the first 5 seconds of stimulation ([@fig:supp2]B). Likewise, crawling behaviour is suppressed throughout the period of stimulation with high intensity stimulation, but at lower intensities larval switch to crawling 5-10s after stimulation onset ([@fig:supp2]A). To determine whether the modulation of escape behaviour by our split lines was consistent at lower stimulus intensities, we repeated our Basin co-activation experiments with an irradiance of 100&mu;W/cm^2^. 

Most results were consistent with the data we collected at higher light intensities. Both *1816* and *4232* both showed significant increases in total roll duration (*p* < .001, *r* = .301 and *p* < .001, *r* = .428, respectively; [@fig:A2_1]C). Notably, *4232* showed an increase in average crabspeed, *p* < .001, *r* = .503 ([@fig:A2_1]D), while *1816* demonstrated decreased average curvature, *p* = .007, *r* = .178 ([@fig:A2_1]E). Line *1816* did also show an increase in average crabspeed, *p* = .003, *r* = .194, but the magnitude of this change was relatively small ([@fig:A2_1]D). This data affirmed our previous observations that both *1816* and *4232* can affect an increase in roll duration, but that *1816* predominantly affects posture (curve) while *4232* primarily affects crabspeed.

To test whether these neurons are necessary for nocifensive behaviour we silenced *1816* and *4232* using the tetanus neurotoxin light chain (TNT) [@Sweeney1995,@Kitamoto2001] whilst applying optogenetic activation of Basin neurons to elicit escape behaviours. We compared these results to a driver control with no split-GAL4 driven TNT expression (*attp2>TNT;Basin>Chrimson*) as well as a within-genotype effector control that expresses an inactive form of TNT (*>impTNT;Basin>Chrimson*). Graphed data were normalised by their respective driver control to visualise the within-genotype effect of TNT expression. Silencing *1816* with TNT expression significantly increased roll duration compared to expression of the null TNT construct, *p* < .001, *r* = .280 ([@fig:A2_1]F). Likewise, TNT expression increased the average curvature of larvae for *1816*, *p* < .001, *r* = .343, and *4232*, *p* = .005, *r* = .297, when compared to null TNT controls ([@fig:A2_1]H). 

Given that the effect of activating or silencing *1816* modulates curvature in opposite directions, the data suggest the activity of *1816* has an inverse relationship with larval curvature during nocifensive behaviour. By contrast, *4232* shows pronounced modulation of rolling and crabspeed when ectopically activated, but its endogenous activity is not necessary for normal presentation of escape behaviours.

### Line *1816* shows behaviour-specific involvement

Having demonstrated that ectopic activation of either *1816* or *4232* can modulate the performance of nocifensive behaviours, we wanted to determine whether they would also affect basal locomotor behaviours. First we decided to perform optogenetic activation of these neurons and assessed metrics associated with crawling (crawl amplitude and frequency) as well as metrics related to baseline turning and casting behaviours (average curvature). Activation of *1816* showed no change to either crawl amplitude or frequency ([@fig:A2_2]A,B) but did show a marginal reduction in average curvature during stimulation, *p* = .049, *r* = .129 ([@fig:A2_2]C). However *4232* showed significant reduction to both crawl amplitude, *p* < .001, *r*  = .354 ([@fig:A2_2]A), and frequency, *p* = .002, *r* = .221 ([@fig:A2_2]B), as well as a increase in average curvature, *p* < .001, *r* = .398 ([@fig:A2_2]C, [@fig:supp3]B). In fact, activation of *4232* reduces the number of larvae presenting crawling behaviour ([@fig:supp3]A). 

Together these results suggest that activation of *1816* has little affect on basal crawling and posture, while *4232* activity disrupts crawling behaviours. Whether this reflects active suppression of crawling circuitry or activation of conflicting motor programs, we cannot yet determine.

To further examine whether these neurons are necessary for basal locomotion of larvae, we decided to perform inhibition of these neurons using a TNT construct. The most notable result was that silencing *4232* reduces the average curvature of the larvae (*p* < .001, *r* = .348, [@fig:A2_2]F), complementing the increase seen with *4232* activation. We also observed a small increase in crawl frequency on silencing *1816*, which is consistent with the literature[@Kohsaka2014], *p* = .004, *r* = .264 ([@fig:A2_2]E). However the magnitude of this effect was small. 

Our data shows that both of the neurons assayed are differentially implicated in nocifensive and basal locomotor behaviours. While *1816* activity modulates nocifensive curvature, it has little effect on basal locomotion. By contrast, *4232* upregulates curvature during basal locomotion, but upregulates crabspeed and rolling during nocifensive behaviours. As such, locomotor modulation by *4232* appears behaviour non-specific.

## Aim 2.2

Having identified that A02e modulates the posture of larvae during escape behaviour, but not basal locomotor behaviours, we wanted to identify which motor neurons and muscles are downstream of A02e. This should allow inference into which motor cohorts are specifically important for facilitating these nocifensive behaviours. Further we wanted to ask whether different motor cohorts were differently implicated in the performance of escape behaviours. To do this we sought to assay PMNs upstream of different motor cohorts. As A02e has been identified as part of the PMSI family we decided to behaviourally characterise different neurons of the A02 lineage. These neurons are morphologically similar [@Kohsaka2014], but the relative differences in their function and connectivity have yet been described. 

### A02 neurons are upstream of different motor cohorts

We searched the [Fly Light Split-GAL4 Driver Collection](https://www.janelia.org/open-science/fly-light-split-gal4-driver-collection) [@Jenett2012] for lines with purported expression in any of the PMSI population and identified lines for A02e (*1816* and *1817*), A02f (*1792*) and A02g (*2175* and *4189*). Imaging the expression of these lines confirmed their selectivity for the aforementioned neurons (data not shown). To determine the connectivity of these neurons we searched for neural reconstructions in a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) volume for an L1 newly hatched larva [@Ohyama2015]. Recent efforts have reconstructed and mapped the synaptic partners of all PMNs and MNs [@Zarin2019a] including those of A02e,f and g. All three neurons form their synaptic partners within the same abdominal segment ([@fig:A2_3a]A,B,C, respectively). Further, their postsynaptic connections form almost exclusively in the ipsilateral motor domain (dorsal neuropil) of the VNC. The distribution of these postsynaptic connections vary along the anteroposterior and mediolateral axis, which likely correspond with the myotopic organisation of motor neuron dendrites in the dorsal neuropil [@Landgraf2003].

A02e makes the majority of its synapses (summarised in [@fig:A2_3b]A) with motor neurons innervating the VL muscles, specifically MN13 (16 per hemisegment, 24.8% of total output), MN30 (12 per hemisegment, 18.6% of total output) and MN12 (8 per hemisegment, 12.4% of total output).  Similarly, A02g predominantly synapses onto motor neurons innervating VL muscles MN13 (16 per hemisegment, 26.2% of total output), MN30 (17 per hemisegment, 27.9% of total output) and MN12 (4.5 per hemisegment, 7.4% of total output).

However, A02e and A02g differ in that A02e also makes a significant proportion of its outputs to motor neurons innervating DL muscles, like MN4 (5.5 per hemisegment, 8.5% of total output), MN10 (4.5 per hemisegment, 7% of total output), MN3 (4 per hemisegment, 6.2% of total output), whereas A02g forms the remainder of its synapses with motor neurons innervating the VO muscles, like MN15/16 (5 per hemisegment, 8.2% of total output) and MN15/16/17 (6 per hemisegment, 9.8% of total output; [@fig:A2_3b]A).

A02f shares most similarities with A02e, innervating MN4 (7.5 per hemisegment, 20.3% of total output) and MN10 (3.5 per hemisegment, 9.5% of total output), both of which project to the DL muscles. However A02f also has unique outputs to the LT projecting motor neurons, MN22/23 (6 per hemisegment, 16.2% of total output) and MN21/22 (2 per hemisegment, 5.4% of total output), as well as the DO projecting motor neuron, MN19 (3.5 per hemisegment, 9.5% of total output; [@fig:A2_3b]A).

Interestingly, A02e and A02g innervate similar patterns of motor neurons as the previously reported Saaghi-1 neuron [@Heckscher2015] ([@fig:A2_3b]A). Disrupting the endogenous activity of Saaghi neurons was shown to induce left-right asymmetric posture during persistaltic crawling. As such, we can use these published results to compare to our own behavioural assays.

All 3 neurons also make premotor-to-premotor connections, but those are not reported here.

### A02e and A02f are sufficient to delay onset of nocifensive behaviour

To test the relative involvement of the different A02 populations in escape behaviour we performed optogenetic co-activation Basin neurons with each of the A02 lines. Given the relative similarity in connectivity between A02e and A02g, we expected these neurons to present the greatest similarity in phenotype.

Consistent with our previous observations, lines expressing A02e showed a delayed peak in the roll percentage ([@fig:A2_4]A). We quantified this delay as the 'latency to first roll' and found significant increases in latency for lines with expression in A02e (*1816*, *p* < .001, *r* = .326, *1817*, *p* < .001, *r* = .290) and A02f, *p* < .001, *r* = .202, compared to a driver control (*attp2;Basin>Chrimson*; [@fig:A2_4]D). 

Further, to determine whether this delay in roll onset reflected delayed change in descriptive metrics, we quantified the latency to crabspeed and latency to curve (defined as the time between stimulus onset and rise in respective metric). Latency to crabspeed was significantly increased for A02f, *p* < .001, *r* =  .291, and for both A02e lines, *1816*, *p* < .001, *r* = .523 and *1817*, *p* < .001, *r* = .475 ([@fig:A2_4]F). All 3 neurons showed an increase in latency to curve, but this effect was greatest for A02e (*1816*, *p* < .001, *r* = .648 and *1817*, *p* < .001, *r* = .660) and A02f (*1792*, *p* < .001, *r* = .344; [@fig:A2_4]H). Together, these results demonstrate that ectopic activation of either A02e or A02f induces a significant delay to both the onset of rolling and C-shape bending, the latter indicated by larval curvature. 

Consistent with our previous data, A02e also showed a significant reduction in average curvature across the stimulation bout, *1816*, *p* < .001, *r* = .648 and *1817*, *p* < .001, *r* = .493 ([@fig:A2_4]I). Interestingly, both A02f and A02g also showed significant reductions in average curvature, but with a smaller magnitude of change. Similarly, all lines tested showed significantly reduced average crabspeed ([@fig:A2_4]G). Only lines labelling A02e showed a significant decrease in total roll duration, *1816*, *p* < .001, *r* = .277 and *1817*, *p* = .029, *r* = .148 ([@fig:A2_4]E). However the size of this effect was relatively small.

These results suggest that all the A02 neurons tested are implicated in the performance of escape behaviours, but that A02e and A02f modulate the most similar aspects of behaviour. Specifically, activation of A02e and A02f delays the onset of both C-bend and roll behaviours. While the overall presentation of rolling seems largely unaffected, given normal roll duration, reduced average curvature suggests the presentation of C-bending is reduced in all lines.

### A02 neurons show minimal modulation of basal locomotion

Our previous data had illustrated that A02e showed behaviour-specific modulation of larval posture, so we wanted to determine whether the other A02 neurons showed similar behavioural specificity. To do this we performed either optogenetic activation or inhibition (TNT) of the A02 neurons during normal exploratory behaviour. 

For all lines there was an overall trend toward a decrease in crawl frequency ([@fig:A2_5]B) when activated, which was mirrored by a general increase in crawl frequency when silenced ([@fig:A2_5]E). While significant, the size of effect from these manipulations was negligible. However, these results are consistent with previous literature implicating the A02 population in regulating peristaltic frequency [@Kohsaka2014]. Genotypes showing a decrease in crawl frequency also showed a decrease in crawl amplitude but, again, the magnitude of this effect was benign ([@fig:A2_5]A). 

Notably, activation of A02f caused a large and significant increase in curvature during stimulation, *p* < .001, *r* = .495 ([@fig:A2_5]C). Specifically, activation of A02f induces a decrease in the percentage of animals crawling ([@fig:supp4]B), followed by an increase in curvature 5 seconds after the onset of stimulation ([@fig:supp4]A). Similarly, activation of *4189* (A02g) also induces a significant increase in curvature, *p* < .001, *r* = .211, but with relatively small magnitude ([@fig:A2_5]C).

Silencing A02 neurons gave significant decreases in average curvature for *1792* (A02f), *p* = .016, *r* = .138, *1817* (A02e), *p* < .001, *r* = .217, and *4189* (A02g), *p* < .001, *r* = .186, but the size of these effects was also negligible. 

These results suggest that none of the neurons in questions are necessary for the performance of crawling behaviour. The only interesting observation was that ectopic activation of A02f induced curved posture. By extension this may implicate the endogenous activity of lateral transverse muscles, which are downstream of A02f, as necessary for maintaining left-right symmetry. However, whether this asymmetry reflects defined unilateral behaviours (e.g. head casting) or just asymmetric gait is unclear from these analyses.

## Aim 2.3

Throughout the literature there are numerous methods which implement different algorithms for the detection of discrete behaviours, like rolling. The extent to which these pipelines reach consensus in the scoring of like-named behaviours is unknown. We wanted to assess whether the phenotypic differences observed for rolling behaviour with A02e, originally scored using the Salam pipeline, are consistently identifiable across 2 other established behavioural pipelines (JB and JAABA).

### A02e phenotype is detectable regardless of analytical method

While the JB pipeline already has a trained classifier for detection of rolling behaviour, we had to train a novel classifier for rolling behaviour with the JAABA pipeline (Shua Noh, unpublished). We processed our optogenetic co-activation experiments for A02e and the driver control (*1816,Basin>Chrimson* and *attp2;Basin>Chrimson*, respectively) with each of the different classification methods. 

The three pipelines showed visible differences in the scoring of roll behaviours for our control data, which serves as our baseline for quantification of escape behaviour. Salam shows the most conservative scoring of rolling behaviour per larvae ([@fig:A1_4]A), whereas JAABA scores with the greatest abundance ([@fig:A1_4]C). This is reflected by the variation in average time-spent rolling, with Salam scoring 2.50 seconds, JB 4.03 seconds and JAABA 7.56 seconds per larva ([@fig:A1_4]H).

When scoring co-activation of Basins and A02e, both the JB and JAABA pipelines show a large decrease in the percentage of animals rolling ([@fig:A1_4]E,F). Notably, we observed an increase in the latency to roll for Salam, *p* < 0.001, *r* = .326, JB, *p* < 0.001, *r* = .662 and JAABA, *p* < 0.001, *r* = .733 ([@fig:A1_4]G). This suggests that the phenotype originally detected with our pipeline is consistent and robust, rather than an artefact from our choice in method.

### Pipelines vary in accuracy and specificity of scoring

Given the magnitude of difference in scored rolling between pipelines, we wanted to understand their relative accuracy and specificity of scoring. To assess this we manually scored 1 timestamp, consisting of 33 larvae, for two different aspects of escape behaviour. We scored both C-bending behaviour (initiation/maintenance of C-shape posture) against rolling behaviour (C-shape posture coincident with lateral movement) as mutually exclusive behaviours (see Methodology). Distinguishing these two behaviours allowed us to evaluate the specificity of either pipeline for rolling versus escape behaviours more generally.

We quantified the performance of the pipelines by their percentage overlap with the ground truth, as well as the duration of false positives scored (summarised in [@fig:A1_5]A). Salam demonstrated the lowest specificity for rolling, labelling 24% of true rolls and 26% of true C-bends ([@fig:A1_5]B). The JB pipeline showed the greatest specificity for scoring rolling, labelling 56% of true rolls compared to just 15% of true C-bends. JAABA also showed improved specificity versus Salam, labelling 87% of true rolls and only 41% of true C-bends ([@fig:A1_5]B).

When assessing false positives, it is important to note that falsely detected "rolls" frequently overlap with true C-bend behaviours. As such, we can assess false positives against rolls separately from false positives against general nocifensive behaviours (combination of roll & C-bend). The JB pipeline demonstrates the greatest accuracy, scoring the fewest false positives for either rolling (.59 seconds per larvae) or nocifensive behaviour generally  (.17 seconds per larvae). Salam and JAABA performed with similar accuracy, scoring false positive rolls at 1.39 and 1.86 seconds per larvae, respectively ([@fig:A1_5]C). Both showed greater accuracy when scoring against nocifensive behaviour in general, scoring fewer than .85 seconds per larvae of false positive behaviour ([@fig:A1_5]C).

These results argue that JB offers best trade off for specificity and accuracy against proportion of behaviours detected. Otherwise JAABA offers the greatest absolute scoring of rolling, but at the cost of some specificity and accuracy.
