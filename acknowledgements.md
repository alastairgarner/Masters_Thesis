First, I owe most of my thanks to Dr Tomoko Ohyama. It's been a genuine pleasure working with you over the past 3 years

I'm truly grateful for the opportunity your offered me, and I'm sure I'm just the first of many students that will graduate under your supervision.
To Jiayi Zhu, you've been an exceptional lab mate. I immensely appreciate the generosity and assistance you've offered throughout my degree. Thanks to Shua Noh, who offered invaluable discussion for analyses, on top of the thankless task of training numerous behavioural classifiers.

To Dr. Ed Ruthazer, I cannot thank you enough for the counsel and mentorship throughout my graduate experience. To Dr. Alanna Watt and Dr. Jon Sakata, working with you both offered precious respite from the doldrums of research. I extend my gratitude to my committee members, Dr Michael Hendricks and Dr Brian Chen, who's encouragement and discussion I deeply appreciate. Finally, I would also like to thank Ronan da Silva and Farin Bourojeni. You both demonstrated immense patience, support and friendship during my earliest days in graduate school.



Aside from the excellent academic mentorship offered by all the aforementioned individuals, I also received invaluable support from the following. My thanks to the gentleman and his father, who's fine establishment, Marche Prima Vera, ensured I was never low on beer. Similarly, my deepest thanks to Dieu du Ciel for that fine, fine Kolsch you call Sentinelle. As too must my thanks go to Helm, who's bumpin' playlists and tasty brews proved, on countless occasions, to be the perfect escape.

For when it was too early for alcohol, I cannot express enough appreciation for Brioche e Tete and Cafe Saint Louis.

To the gentleman and his father, the names of whom I never learned, who own Marche Prima Vera - you never judged when I returned for a second case of beer in the same evening. 



Brioche e tete, cafe Saint Louis, Guillaume bakery, both Fairmount & Saint Viateur bagel.
