# Hello 



First, I owe most of my thanks to Dr Tomoko Ohyama - it's been a genuine pleasure working with you over the past 3 years. I'm truly grateful for the opportunity your offered me, and I'm sure I'm just the first of many students that will graduate under your supervision. To Jiayi Zhu, you've been an exceptional lab mate. I immensely appreciate the generosity and assistance you've offered throughout my degree. Thanks to Shua Noh, who offered invaluable discussion for analyses, on top of the thankless task of training numerous behavioural classifiers.



To Dr. Ed Ruthazer, I cannot thank you enough for the counsel and mentorship throughout my graduate experience. To Dr. Alanna Watt and Dr. Jon Sakata, working with you both offered precious respite from the doldrums of research. I extend my gratitude to my committee members, Dr Michael Hendricks and Dr Brian Chen, who's encouragement and discussion I deeply appreciate. Finally, I would also like to thank Ronan da Silva and Farin Bourojeni, who both demonstrated immense patience, support and friendship during my earliest days in graduate school.



For the beers, I thank Dieu du Ciel, Helm and both the gentleman who owns my local depennaur, as well as his father. For the coffee and the butteriest pastries, my sincere thanks to Brioche à tête and Cafe Saint Louis. And for the copious volume of bagels and bread, my thanks to Guillaume, Fairmount Bagel and Saint Viateur bagel, for I truly have no preference...

A special thanks goes to the entire McElroy family, whos podcasts brought laughter even during the bleakest of experiments. The most heartfelt of thanks goes to White Denim, for 4 albums of sweet rockin' rock 'n' roll, in as many years.



I cannot offer enough thanks for the overwhelming support and holiday pub trips from friends back home, to Sam McArdle, Savva Theocharous, Mike Simargool, Will Beedham, Matt Harris, Will Mason, Greg Albery and Jonty Lord. As many thanks again go to Maria Vila de Mucha, for providing much of the emotional support necessary for me to finish this degree. To my roommates, for those all important board game nights, I thank Chase Clark, Kaan Salçın and Lee Rannells. And to Izzy Groves and Travis Moore, I cannot give enough thanks for the countless laughs and happy squash sessions.



To my family, I could write another whole acknowledgements page. It's almost unreasonable how much confidence, support and 



Fam

Finally to Kat Cruickshank, the poor soul who's coaxed me through these last two years.

It's over. Go home. 

Go!"

Aside from the excellent academic mentorship offered by all of the aforementioned individuals, I also received invaluable support from the following. My thanks to the gentleman and his father, who's fine establishment, Marche Prima Vera, ensured I was never low on beer. Similarly, my deepest thanks to Dieu du Ciel for that fine, fine Kolsch you call Sentinelle. As too must my thanks go to Helm, who's bumpin' playlists and tasty brews proved, on countless occasions, to be the perfect escape.

For when it was too early for alcohol, I cannot express enough appreciation for Brioche e Tete and Cafe Saint Louis
