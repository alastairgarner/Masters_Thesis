abstract = {Wereport the larval CNS expression patterns for 6,650 GAL4 lines based on cis-regulatory regions (CRMs) from the Drosophila genome. Adult CNS expression patterns were previously reported for this collection, thereby providing a unique resource for determining the origins of adult cells. An illustrative example reveals the origin of the astrocyte-like glia of the ventral CNS. Besides larval neurons and glia, the larval CNS contains scattered lineages of immature, adultspecific neurons. Comparison of lineage expression within this large collection of CRMs provides insight into the codes used for designating neuronal types. The CRMs encode both dense and sparse patterns of lineage expression. There is little correlation between brain and thoracic lineages in patterns of sparse expression, but expression in the two regions is highly correlated in the dense mode. The optic lobes, by comparison, appear to use a different set of genetic instructions in their development.},

abstract = {The mechanisms specifying neuronal diversity are well-characterized, yet it remains unclear how these mechanisms are used to establish neuronal morphology and connectivity. Here we map the developmental origin of over 78 neurons from seven identified neural progenitors (neuroblasts) within a complete TEM reconstruction of the Drosophila larval CNS. This allowed us to correlate developmental mechanism with neuronal projection and synapse targeting. We find that clonally-related neurons from individual neuroblasts project widely in the neuropil without preferential circuit formation. In contrast, the two NotchON/NotchOFF hemilineages from each neuroblast project to restricted dorsal/motor neuropil domains (NotchON) and ventral/sensory neuropil domains (NotchOFF). Thus, each neuroblast contributes both motor and sensory processing neurons, although they share little connectivity. Lineage-specific constitutive Notch transforms sensory to motor hemilineages, showing hemilineage identity determines neuronal targeting. Within a hemilineage, neurons of different temporal cohorts target their synapses to different sub-domains of the neuropil. Importantly, neurons sharing a sub-domain defined by hemilineage and temporal identity preferentially connect to neurons of another hemilineage/temporal profile. We propose that the mechanisms that generate neural diversity are also determinants of neural circuit formation.},

abstract = {1. Pyramidal neurones from layers II and III of the rat primary somatosensory cortex and cat primary visual cortex were studied in vitro. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and responses to exogenously applied gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and its analogue baclofen were characterized. The results from rats and cats were very similar. 2. Single electrical stimuli to deep cortical layers evoked a sequence of PSPs in the resting neurone: (a) an initial, brief excitation (EPSP), (b) a short-latency, fast inhibition (the f-IPSP) and (c) a long-latency, more prolonged inhibition (the l-IPSP). The f-IPSP was accompanied by a large conductance increase (about 70-90 nS) and reversed polarity at -75 mV; the l-IPSP displayed a relatively small conductance increase (about 10-20 nS) and reversed at greater than -90 mV. 3. Focal application of GABA near the soma evoked a triphasic response when measured near the threshold voltage for action potentials: (a) the GABAhf (hyperpolarizing, fast) phase was very brief and was generated by a large conductance increase with a reversal potential of -78 mV, (b) the GABAd (depolarizing) phase also had a high conductance but reversed at -51 mV, (c) the GABAhl (hyperpolarizing, long-lasting) phase had a relatively low conductance and reversed at -70 mV. The GABAhf response was specifically localized to the soma, whereas the apical or basilar dendrites generated predominantly GABAd responses. 4. Baclofen, a selective GABAB receptor agonist, caused a small (about 2 mV), slow hyperpolarization of the resting potential, which reversed at -90 mV. Saturating baclofen doses increased membrane conductance by a maximum of about 12 nS. Baclofen depressed the amplitude and conductance of PSPs; when baclofen was focally applied near the soma. IPSPs were selectively depressed. 5. The GABAA receptor antagonists bicuculline methiodide or picrotoxin (10 microM) greatly depressed f-IPSPs, but either enhanced or did not affect l-IPSPs. Concomitantly, GABAhf and GABAd responses were antagonized, leaving a more prominent GABAhl response that reversed polarity at a more negative level of -87 mV. Baclofen responses were unaffected by bicuculline and picrotoxin. Extracellular barium abolished the baclofen response, and shifted the reversal potentials of the GABAd and GABAhl responses in the positive direction; the GABAhf response was unaffected. 6. Both focal GABA and f-IPSPs strongly depressed the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurones. Each greatly increased spike threshold and abolished or vastly reduced the capacity of the cells to fire repetitively during intense stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Slow-wave sleep (SWS) is important for memory consolidation. During sleep, neural patterns reflecting previously acquired information are replayed. One possible reason for this is that such replay exchanges information between hippocampus and neocortex, supporting consolidation. We recorded neuron ensembles in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to study memory trace reactivation during SWS following learning and execution of cross-modal strategy shifts. In general, reactivation of learning-related patterns occurred in distinct, highly synchronized transient bouts, mostly simultaneous with hippocampal sharp wave/ripple complexes (SPWRs), when hippocampal ensemble reactivation and cortico-hippocampal interaction is enhanced. During sleep following learning of a new rule, mPFC neural patterns that appeared during response selection replayed prominently, coincident with hippocampal SPWRs. This was learning dependent, as the patterns appeared only after rule acquisition. Therefore, learning, or the resulting reliable reward, influenced which patterns were most strongly encoded and successively reactivated in the hippocampal/prefrontal network.},

@article{ORegan2001,
abstract = {Many current neurophysiological, psychophysical, and psychological approaches to vision rest on the idea that when we see, the brain produces an internal representation of the world. The activation of this internal representation is assumed to give rise to the experience of seeing. The problem with this kind of approach is that it leaves unexplained how the existence of such a detailed internal representation might produce visual consciousness. An alternative proposal is made here. We propose that seeing is a way of acting. It is a particular way of exploring the environment. Activity in internal representations does not generate the experience of seeing. The outside world serves as its own, external, representation. The experience of seeing occurs when the organism masters what we call the governing laws of sensorimotor contingency. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a natural and principled way of accounting for visual consciousness, and for the differences in the perceived quality of sensory experience in the different sensory modalities. Several lines of empirical evidence are brought forward in support of the theory, in particular: evidence from experiments in sensorimotor adaptation, visual "filling in," visual stability despite eye movements, change blindness, sensory substitution, and color perception.},

abstract = {It has been conjectured that nonlinear processing in dendritic branches endows individual neurons with the capability to perform complex computational operations that are needed to solve for example the binding problem. However, it is not clear how single neurons could acquire such functionality in a self-organized manner, because most theoretical studies of synaptic plasticity and learning concentrate on neuron models without nonlinear dendritic properties. In the meantime, a complex picture of information processing with dendritic spikes and a variety of plasticity mechanisms in single neurons has emerged from experiments. In particular, new experimental data on dendritic branch strength potentiation in rat hippocampus have not yet been incorporated into such models. In this article, we investigate how experimentally observed plasticity mechanisms, such as depolarization-dependent spike-timing-dependent plasticity and branch-strength potentiation, could be integrated to self-organize nonlinear neural computations with dendritic spikes. We provide a mathematical proof that, in a simplified setup, these plasticity mechanisms induce a competition between dendritic branches, a novel concept in the analysis of single neuron adaptivity. We show via computer simulations that such dendritic competition enables a single neuron to become member of several neuronal ensembles and to acquire nonlinear computational capabilities, such as the capability to bind multiple input features. Hence, our results suggest that nonlinear neural computation may self-organize in single neurons through the interaction of local synaptic and dendritic plasticity mechanisms.},

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is necessary for LTP induction, is persistently activated by stimuli that elicit LTP, and can, by itself, enhance the efficacy of synaptic transmission. The analysis of CaMKII autophosphorylation and dephosphorylation indicates that this kinase could serve as a molecular switch that is capable of long-term memory storage. Consistent with such a role, mutations that prevent persistent activation of CaMKII block LTP, experience-dependent plasticity and behavioural memory. These results make CaMKII a leading candidate in the search for the molecular basis of memory.},

abstract = {A longstanding goal of systems neuroscience is to quantitatively describe how the brain integrates cues from multiple modalities over time. Here we develop a closed-loop orienting paradigm in Drosophila to study the algorithms by which stimuli from different modalities are combined during ongoing navigation. We show that flies faced with an attractive visual and an aversive mechanosensory cue exhibit sequential responses, first turning away from the co-localized stimuli before turning back toward them. We also find that the presence of the aversive cue slows flies' turns toward the attractive target, suggesting that conflicting unimodal turn commands are summed to produce multisensory turns of intermediate velocity. We then test a series of computational frameworks and find that integration is best described by a model in which multimodal stimuli are continuously and dynamically scaled, converted into turn commands, and then summed to produce ongoing orientation behavior.},

abstract = {Brain-machine interfaces use neuronal activity recorded from the brain to establish direct communication with external actuators, such as prosthetic arms. It is hoped that brain-machine interfaces can be used to restore the normal sensorimotor functions of the limbs, but so far they have lacked tactile sensation. Here we report the operation of a brain-machine-brain interface (BMBI) that both controls the exploratory reaching movements of an actuator and allows signalling of artificial tactile feedback through intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex. Monkeys performed an active exploration task in which an actuator (a computer cursor or a virtual-reality arm) was moved using a BMBI that derived motor commands from neuronal ensemble activity recorded in the primary motor cortex. ICMS feedback occurred whenever the actuator touched virtual objects. Temporal patterns of ICMS encoded the artificial tactile properties of each object. Neuronal recordings and ICMS epochs were temporally multiplexed to avoid interference. Two monkeys operated this BMBI to search for and distinguish one of three visually identical objects, using the virtual-reality arm to identify the unique artificial texture associated with each. These results suggest that clinical motor neuroprostheses might benefit from the addition of ICMS feedback to generate artificial somatic perceptions associated with mechanical, robotic or even virtual prostheses.},

abstract = {The phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and downstream mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling cascades promote normal growth and are frequently hyperactivated in tumour cells. mTORC1 is also regulated by local nutrients, particularly amino acids, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Unexpectedly, members of the proton-assisted amino-acid transporter (PAT or SLC36) family emerged from in vivo genetic screens in Drosophila as transporters with uniquely potent effects on mTORC1-mediated growth. In this study, we show the two human PATs that are widely expressed in normal tissues and cancer cell lines, namely PAT1 and PAT4, behave similarly to fly PATs when expressed in Drosophila. Small interfering RNA knockdown shows that these molecules are required for the activation of mTORC1 targets and for proliferation in human MCF-7 breast cancer and HEK-293 embryonic kidney cell lines. Furthermore, activation of mTORC1 in starved HEK-293 cells stimulated by amino acids requires PAT1 and PAT4, and is elevated in PAT1-overexpressing cells. Importantly, in HEK-293 cells, PAT1 is highly concentrated in intracellular compartments, including endosomes, wherein mTOR shuttles upon amino-acid stimulation. Therefore our data are consistent with a model in which PATs modulate the activity of mTORC1 not by transporting amino acids into the cell but by modulating the intracellular response to amino acids.},

We undertook genome-wide analyses to identify DSX targets using in vivo occupancy, binding site prediction, and evolutionary conservation.

abstract = {Locomotion relies on neural networks called central pattern generators (CPGs) that generate periodic motor commands for rhythmic movements. In vertebrates, the excitatory synaptic drive for inducing the spinal CPG can originate from either supraspinal glutamatergic inputs or from within the spinal cord. Here we identify a spinal input to the CPG that drives spontaneous locomotion using a combination of intersectional gene expression and optogenetics in zebrafish larvae. The photo-stimulation of one specific cell type was sufficient to induce a symmetrical tail beating sequence that mimics spontaneous slow forward swimming. This neuron is the Kolmer-Agduhr cell, which extends cilia into the central cerebrospinal-fluid-containing canal of the spinal cord and has an ipsilateral ascending axon that terminates in a series of consecutive segments. Genetically silencing Kolmer-Agduhr cells reduced the frequency of spontaneous free swimming, indicating that activity of Kolmer-Agduhr cells provides necessary tone for spontaneous forward swimming. Kolmer-Agduhr cells have been known for over 75 years, but their function has been mysterious. Our results reveal that during early development in zebrafish these cells provide a positive drive to the spinal CPG for spontaneous locomotion.},

abstract = {Like many adaptive behaviors, acoustic communication often requires rapid modification of motor output in response to sensory cues. However, little is known about the sensorimotor transformations that underlie such complex natural behaviors. In this study, we examine vocal exchanges in Alston's singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina). We find that males modify singing behavior during social interactions on a subsecond time course that resembles both traditional sensorimotor tasks and conversational speech. We identify an orofacial motor cortical region and, via a series of perturbation experiments, demonstrate a hierarchical control of vocal production, with the motor cortex influencing the pacing of singing behavior on a moment-by-moment basis, enabling precise vocal interactions. These results suggest a systems-level framework for understanding the sensorimotor transformations that underlie natural social interactions.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc participate in the control of genetic events which lead to the establishment of prolonged functional changes in neurons. Expression of c-fos and c-myc are among the earliest genetic events induced in cultured fibroblast and phaeochromocytoma cell lines by various stimuli including growth factors, peptides and the intracellular second messengers diacylglycerol, cAMP and Ca2+. We report here that physiological stimulation of rat primary sensory neurons causes the expression of c-fos-protein-like immunoreactivity in nuclei of postsynaptic neurons of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Activation of small-diameter cutaneous sensory afferents by noxious heat or chemical stimuli results in the rapid appearance of c-fos-protein-like immunoreactivity in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn. However, activation of low-threshold cutaneous afferents results in fewer labelled cells with a different laminar distribution. No c-fos induction was seen in the dorsal root ganglia, gracile nucleus or ventral horn. Thus, synaptic transmission may induce rapid changes in gene expression in certain postsynaptic neurons.},

abstract = {Multireceptive neurones are found in the spinal dorsal horn and may be projection neurones and/or interneurones for polysynaptic reflexes. The cutaneous receptive field of a multireceptive neurone exhibits a gradient of sensitivity with the centre responding to any mechanical stimulus, including hair movements and light touch, while the periphery responds only to noxious stimuli. These neurones also receive signals from viscera, muscles and joints. This convergence of inputs means that multireceptive neurones are continuously capturing all the information from both the interface with the external environment (the skin) and the internal milieu (the viscera, muscles, etc.). This information constitutes a 'basic somaesthetic activity' that could help the somatosensory system build a 'global representation of the body'. In addition to be seen as a global entity, the output of multireceptive neurones should be understood in dynamic terms since the size of the peripheral fields of the individual neurones may change, as a result of the plasticity of both excitatory and inhibitory segmental processes. Furthermore, the activity of these neurones can be inhibited from most of the remaining parts of the body via supraspinal mechanisms. These diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) are triggered by peripheral A$\delta$- and C-fibres, involve brain structures confined to the caudal-most part of the medulla including the subnucleus reticularis dorsalis (SRD) and are mediated by descending pathways in the dorsolateral funiculi. A painful focus that both activates a segmental subset of neurones and inhibits the remaining population can seriously disrupt this basic activity, resulting in the distortion of the body representation in favour of the painful focus, which becomes pre-eminent and (relatively) oversized. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Rapidly decaying [Ca(2+)] elevations were generated using Ca(2+) uncaging techniques, and [Ca(2+)] was measured with a low-affinity Ca(2+) indicator in a giant presynaptic terminal, the calyx of Held, in rat brain slices. The rise time and amplitude of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) depended on the half-width of the fluorescence transient, which was predicted by a five-binding site model of a Ca(2+) sensor having relatively high affinity (K(d) approximately 13 microM). Very fast [Ca(2+)] transients (half-width {\textless}0.5 ms) evoked EPSCs similar to those elicited by a single action potential (AP) in the same synapse. Triggering release with dual [Ca(2+)] transients of variable amplitudes demonstrated the supralinear transfer function of the sensor. The sensitivity of release to the time course of the [Ca(2+)] transient may contribute to mechanisms by which the presynaptic AP waveform controls synaptic strength.},

abstract = {Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to promote neuronal survival and differentiation and to guide axon extension both in vitro and in vivo. The BDNF-induced chemo-attraction of axonal growth cones requires Ca2+ signalling, but how Ca2+ is regulated by BDNF at the growth cone remains largely unclear. Extracellular application of BDNF triggers membrane currents resembling those through TRPC (transient receptor potential canonical) channels in rat pontine neurons and in Xenopus spinal neurons. Here, we report that in cultured cerebellar granule cells, TRPC channels contribute to the BDNF-induced elevation of Ca2+ at the growth cone and are required for BDNF-induced chemo-attractive turning. Several members of the TRPC family are highly expressed in these neurons, and both Ca2+ elevation and growth-cone turning induced by BDNF are abolished by pharmacological inhibition of TRPC channels, overexpression of a dominant-negative form of TRPC3 or TRPC6, or downregulation of TRPC3 expression via short interfering RNA. Thus, TRPC channel activity is essential for nerve-growth-cone guidance by BDNF.},

abstract = {The photopigment melanopsin confers photosensitivity upon a minority of retinal output neurons. These intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are more diverse than once believed, comprising five morphologically distinct types, M1 through M5. Here, in mouse retina, we provide the first in-depth characterization of M4 cells, including their structure, function, and central projections. M4 cells apparently correspond to ON $\alpha$ cells of earlier reports, and are easily distinguished from other ipRGCs by their very large somata. Their dendritic arbors are more radiate and highly branched than those of M1, M2, or M3 cells. The melanopsin-based intrinsic photocurrents of M4 cells are smaller than those of M1 and M2 cells, presumably because melanopsin is more weakly expressed; we can detect it immunohistochemically only with strong amplification. Like M2 cells, M4 cells exhibit robust, sustained, synaptically driven ON responses and dendritic stratification in the ON sublamina of the inner plexiform layer. However, their stratification patterns are subtly different, with M4 dendrites positioned just distal to those of M2 cells and just proximal to the ON cholinergic band. M4 receptive fields are large, with an ON center, antagonistic OFF surround and nonlinear spatial summation. Their synaptically driven photoresponses lack direction selectivity and show higher ultraviolet sensitivity in the ventral retina than in the dorsal retina, echoing the topographic gradient in S- and M-cone opsin expression. M4 cells are readily labeled by retrograde transport from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and thus likely contribute to the pattern vision that persists in mice lacking functional rods and cones.},

Here, we review current knowledge of mouse L2/3 sensory cortex, focusing on somatosensory barrel cortex with comparisons to visual and auditory cortex. Broadly tuned, dense subthreshold synaptic input accompanied by sparse action potential (AP) firing in excitatory neurons provides a simple and reliable neural code useful for associative learning. Sparse AP firing is enforced by strong inhibition from genetically defined classes of GABAergic neurons. Subnetworks of strongly and specifically connected excitatory neurons may drive L2/3 network function, with potential contributions from dendritic spikes evoked by spatiotemporally clustered synaptic input. These functional properties of L2/3 are under profound regulation by brain state and behavior, providing interesting avenues for future mechanistic investigations into context-specific processing of sensory information},

CCT reveals the coexistence of specific transmitters but mutual exclusion of the major inhibitory and excitatory transmitters in the same neurons. One neuropeptide and five receptors were detected in glia, with octopamine $\beta$2 receptor functioning in glia. A pilot screen implicated 41 genes in sleep regulation, with the dopamine receptor Dop2R functioning in neurons expressing the peptides Dilp2 and SIFa. Thus, CCT is a novel concept, chemoconnectomics a new approach, and CCT tool lines a powerful resource for systematic investigations of chemical-transmission-mediated neural signaling circuits underlying behavior and cognition.

Much of the recent progress in understanding how single genes can influence behavior has come from the study of innate behaviors in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In particular, the elaborate courtship ritual performed by the male fly has provided remarkable insights into how the neural circuitry underlying sexual behavior--which is largely innate in flies--is built into the nervous system during development, and how this circuitry functions in the adult. In this review we will discuss how genes of the sex determination pathway in Drosophila orchestrate the developmental events necessary for sex-specific behaviors and physiology, and the broader lessons this can teach us about the mechanisms underlying the development of sex-specific neural circuitry.},

abstract = {While often considered to be a simple and stereotyped motor behavior, effective locomotion entails complex changes in vigor, speed, and gait. Studies over several decades in many species have uncovered the basic building blocks of the spinal locomotor CPG. More recently, however, the combination of molecular, electrophysiological, and anatomical tools has begun to uncover a higher degree of neuronal and circuit diversity that endows the locomotor CPG with the necessary flexibility to adjust the vigor, speed, and gait of locomotor movements to internal and external demands. In this review, we summarize some of these recent studies with a focus on how the diversity of neurons in zebrafish generates a modular organization of the locomotor CPG, with individual module components engaged in a task-dependent manner. In addition, we highlight recent evidence on the role of motoneurons as an integral member of the locomotor CPG in vertebrates. Thus, studies of the spinal locomotor networks are beginning to provide direct links between neuronal diversity, their circuit organization and behavioral relevance.},

Invasive BCIs, almost exclusively investigated in animal models using implanted electrodes in brain tissue, and noninvasive BCIs using electrophysiological recordings in humans are described. Clinical applications were reserved with few exceptions for the noninvasive approach: communication with the completely paralyzed and locked-in syndrome with slow cortical potentials, sensorimotor rhythm and P300, and restoration of movement and cortical reorganization in high spinal cord lesions and chronic stroke. It was demonstrated that noninvasive EEG-based BCIs allow brain-derived communication in paralyzed and locked-in patients but not in completely locked-in patients. At present no firm conclusion about the clinical utility of BCI for the control of voluntary movement can be made. Invasive multielectrode BCIs in otherwise healthy animals allowed execution of reaching, grasping, and force variations based on spike patterns and extracellular field potentials. The newly developed fMRI-BCIs and NIRS-BCIs, like EEG BCIs, offer promise for the learned regulation of emotional disorders and also disorders of young children.},

abstract = {Sensory experience orchestrates the development ofcortical circuitry by adaptively modifying neurotransmission and synaptic connectivity. However, the mechanisms underlying these experience-dependent modifications remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that visual experience suppresses a presynaptic NMDA receptor (preNMDAR)-mediated form of timing-dependent long-term depression (tLTD) at visual cortex layer (L) 4-2/3 synapses. This tLTD can be maintained during development, or reinstated in adulthood, by sensory deprivation. The changes in tLTD are mirrored by changes in glutamate release; visual deprivation enhances both tLTD and glutamate release. These effects require the GluN3A NMDAR subunit, the levels of which are increased by visual deprivation. Further, by coupling the pathway-specific optogenetic induction of tLTD with cell-type-specific NMDAR deletion, we find that visual experience modifies preNMDAR-mediated plasticity specifically at L4-L2/3 synapses. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Identifying the spatial organization of tissues at cellular resolution from single-cell gene expression profiles is essential to understanding biological systems. Using an in??situ 3D multiplexed imaging method, seqFISH, we identify unique transcriptional states by quantifying and clustering up to 249 genes in 16,958 cells to examine whether the hippocampus is organized into transcriptionally distinct subregions. We identified distinct layers in the dentate gyrus corresponding to the granule cell layer and the subgranular zone and, contrary to previous reports, discovered that distinct subregions within the CA1 and CA3 are composed of unique combinations of cells in different transcriptional states. In addition, we found that the dorsal CA1 is relatively homogeneous at the single cell level, while ventral CA1 is highly heterogeneous. These structures and patterns are observed using different mice and different sets of genes. Together, these results demonstrate the power of seqFISH in transcriptional profiling of complex tissues.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitters are released at presynaptic active zones (AZs). In the fly Drosophila, monoclonal antibody (MAB) nc82 specifically labels AZs. We employ nc82 to identify Bruchpilot protein (BRP) as a previously unknown AZ component. BRP shows homology to human AZ protein ELKS/CAST/ERC, which binds RIM1 in a complex with Bassoon and Munc13-1. The C terminus of BRP displays structural similarities to multifunctional cytoskeletal proteins. During development, transcription of the bruchpilot locus (brp) coincides with neuronal differentiation. Panneural reduction of BRP expression by RNAi constructs permits a first functional characterization of this large AZ protein: larvae show reduced evoked but normal spontaneous transmission at neuromuscular junctions. In adults, we observe loss of T bars at active zones, absence of synaptic components in electroretinogram, locomotor inactivity, and unstable flight (hence "bruchpilot" - crash pilot). We propose that BRP is critical for intact AZ structure and normal-evoked neurotransmitter release at chemical synapses of Drosophila. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) is thought to serve as an elementary mechanism for the establishment of certain forms of explicit memory in the mammalian brain. As is the case with behavioral memory, LTP in the CA1 region has stages: a short-term early potentiation lasting 1 to 3 hours, which is independent of protein synthesis, precedes a later, longer lasting stage (L-LTP), which requires protein synthesis. Inhibitors of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) blocked L-LTP, and analogs of cAMP induced a potentiation that blocked naturally induced L-LTP. The action of the cAMP analog was blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis. Thus, activation of PKA may be a component of the mechanism that generates L-LTP.},

abstract = {The effects of lesions, receptor blocking, electrical self-stimulation, and drugs of abuse suggest that midbrain dopamine systems are involved in processing reward information and learning approach behavior. Most dopamine neurons show phasic activations after primary liquid and food rewards and conditioned, reward-predicting visual and auditory stimuli. They show biphasic, activation-depression responses after stimuli that resemble reward-predicting stimuli or are novel or particularly salient. However, only few phasic activations follow aversive stimuli. Thus dopamine neurons label environmental stimuli with appetitive value, predict and detect rewards and signal alerting and motivating events. By failing to discriminate between different rewards, dopamine neurons appear to emit an alerting message about the surprising presence or absence of rewards. All responses to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli depend on event predictability. Dopamine neurons are activated by rewarding events that are better than predicted, remain uninfluenced by events that are as good as predicted, and are depressed by events that are worse than predicted. By signaling rewards according to a prediction error, dopamine responses have the formal characteristics of a teaching signal postulated by reinforcement learning theories. Dopamine responses transfer during learning from primary rewards to reward-predicting stimuli. This may contribute to neuronal mechanisms underlying the retrograde action of rewards, one of the main puzzles in reinforcement learning. The impulse response releases a short pulse of dopamine onto many dendrites, thus broadcasting a rather global reinforcement signal to postsynaptic neurons. This signal may improve approach behavior by providing advance reward information before the behavior occurs, and may contribute to learning by modifying synaptic transmission. The dopamine reward signal is supplemented by activity in neurons in striatum, frontal cortex, and amygdala, which process specific reward information but do not emit a global reward prediction error signal. A cooperation between the different reward signals may assure the use of specific rewards for selectively reinforcing behaviors. Among the other projection systems, noradrenaline neurons predominantly serve attentional mechanisms and nucleus basalis neurons code rewards heterogeneously. Cerebellar climbing fibers signal errors in motor performance or errors in the prediction of aversive events to cerebellar Purkinje cells. Most deficits following dopamine-depleting lesions are not easily explained by a defective reward signal but may reflect the absence of a general enabling function of tonic levels of extracellular dopamine. Thus dopamine systems may have two functions, the phasic transmission of reward information and the tonic enabling of postsynaptic neurons.},

Both strategies increased mEPSC frequency and dendritic arbor complexity in tectal neurons over 3 days. Expression of either of two constitutively active Xenopus NFATs (CA-NFATs) restored normal synaptic properties in neurons expressing N-VIVIT. However, the morphological phenotype was only rescued by a CA-NFAT bearing an intact regulatory domain, implying that transcriptional control of morphological and electrophysiological properties of neurons is mediated by distinct NFAT interactions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, commercial systems that allow these types of experiments are usually expensive and rely on non-standardized data formats and proprietary software which may hinder user-modifications for specific needs. In order to promote reproducibility and data-sharing in science, transparent software and standardized data formats are an advantage. Here, we present an open source, low-cost, adaptable, and easy to set-up system for combined behavioral tracking, electrophysiology, and closed-loop stimulation. APPROACH Based on the Open Ephys system (www.open-ephys.org) we developed multiple modules to include real-time tracking and behavior-based closed-loop stimulation. We describe the equipment and provide a step-by-step guide to set up the system. Combining the open source software Bonsai (bonsai-rx.org) for analyzing camera images in real time with the newly developed modules in Open Ephys, we acquire position information, visualize tracking, and perform tracking-based closed-loop stimulation experiments. To analyze the acquired data we provide an open source file reading package in Python. MAIN RESULTS The system robustly visualizes real-time tracking and reliably recovers tracking information recorded from a range of sampling frequencies (30-1000 Hz). We combined electrophysiology with the newly-developed tracking modules in Open Ephys to record place cell and grid cell activity in the hippocampus and in the medial entorhinal cortex, respectively. Moreover, we present a case in which we used the system for closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of entorhinal grid cells. SIGNIFICANCE Expanding the Open Ephys system to include animal tracking and behavior-based closed-loop stimulation extends the availability of high-quality, low-cost experimental setup within standardized data formats serving the neuroscience community.},

abstract = {Ca2+-triggered synchronous neurotransmitter release is well described, but asynchronous release-in fact, its very existence-remains enigmatic. Here we report a quantitative description of asynchronous neurotransmitter release in calyx-of-Held synapses. We show that deletion of synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2) in mice selectively abolishes synchronous release, allowing us to study pure asynchronous release in isolation. Using photolysis experiments of caged Ca2+, we demonstrate that asynchronous release displays a Ca2+ cooperativity of approximately 2 with a Ca2+ affinity of approximately 44 microM, in contrast to synchronous release, which exhibits a Ca2+ cooperativity of approximately 5 with a Ca2+ affinity of approximately 38 muM. Our results reveal that release triggered in wild-type synapses at low Ca2+ concentrations is physiologically asynchronous, and that asynchronous release completely empties the readily releasable pool of vesicles during sustained elevations of Ca2+. We propose a dual-Ca2+-sensor model of release that quantitatively describes the contributions of synchronous and asynchronous release under conditions of different presynaptic Ca2+ dynamics.},

abstract = {The ability to continuously adjust posture and balance is necessary for reliable motor behavior. Vestibular and proprioceptive systems influence postural adjustments during movement by signaling functionally complementary sensory information. Using viral tracing and mouse genetics, we reveal two patterns of synaptic specificity between brainstem vestibular neurons and spinal motor neurons, established through distinct mechanisms. First, vestibular input targets preferentially extensor over flexor motor pools, a pattern established by developmental refinement in part controlled by vestibular signaling. Second, vestibular input targets slow-twitch over fast motor neuron subtypes within extensor pools, while proprioceptors exhibit inversely correlated connectivity profiles. Genetic manipulations affecting the functionality of proprioceptive feedback circuits lead to adjustments in vestibular input to motor neuron subtypes counterbalancing the imposed changes, without changing the sparse vestibular input to flexor pools. Thus, two sensory signaling systems interact to establish complementary synaptic input patterns to the final site of motor output processing.},

However, the sufficiency of these neurons to control behavior and the relationship of their activity to the magnitude and dynamics of feeding are unknown. To measure this, we used channelrhodopsin-2 for cell type-specific photostimulation. Activation of only 800 AGRP neurons in mice evoked voracious feeding within minutes. The behavioral response increased with photoexcitable neuron number, photostimulation frequency and stimulus duration. Conversely, POMC neuron stimulation reduced food intake and body weight, which required melanocortin receptor signaling. However, AGRP neuron-mediated feeding was not dependent on suppressing this melanocortin pathway, indicating that AGRP neurons directly engage feeding circuits. Furthermore, feeding was evoked selectively over drinking without training or prior photostimulus exposure, which suggests that AGRP neurons serve a dedicated role coordinating this complex behavior.},

This learning occurs when the sensory cues are paired with an aversive event occurring in close temporal proximity. Activation of lateral amygdala (LA) pyramidal neurons by aversive stimuli is thought to drive the formation of these associative fear memories; yet, there have been no direct tests of this hypothesis. Here we demonstrate that viral-targeted, tissue-specific expression of the light-activated channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in LA pyramidal cells permitted optical control of LA neuronal activity. Using this approach we then paired an auditory sensory cue with optical stimulation of LA pyramidal neurons instead of an aversive stimulus. Subsequently presentation of the tone alone produced behavioral fear responses. These results demonstrate in vivo optogenetic control of LA neurons and provide compelling support for the idea that fear learning is instructed by aversive stimulus-induced activation of LA pyramidal cells.},

We propose a parametric combination of LCSS and derivative DTW. The new dissimilarity measure is used in classification with the 1NN rule. We empirically compare our new approach to LCSS and DTW used separately and demonstrate its superiority in classification accuracy.

Moreover, shifts between expression and extinction circuits involve coordinated interactions with different regions of the medial prefrontal cortex. However, key areas of uncertainty remain, particularly with respect to the connectivity of the different cell types. Filling these gaps in our knowledge is important because much evidence indicates that human anxiety disorders results from an abnormal regulation of the networks supporting fear learning.

Although striatal circuits have been implicated in action selection and implementation, the neural mechanisms that compose behavior in unrestrained animals are not well understood. Here, we record bulk and cellular neural activity in the direct and indirect pathways of dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as mice spontaneously express action sequences. These experiments reveal that DLS neurons systematically encode information about the identity and ordering of sub-second 3D behavioral motifs; this encoding is facilitated by fast-timescale decorrelations between the direct and indirect pathways. Furthermore, lesioning the DLS prevents appropriate sequence assembly during exploratory or odor-evoked behaviors. By characterizing naturalistic behavior at neural timescales, these experiments identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics built from complementary pathway dynamics, support a role for DLS in constructing meaningful behavioral sequences, and suggest models for how actions are sculpted over time.},

abstract = {A wide range of organisms use sex pheromones to communicate with each other and to identify appropriate mating partners. While the evolution of chemical communication has been suggested to cause sexual isolation and speciation, the mechanisms that govern evolutionary transitions in sex pheromone production are poorly understood. Here, we decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the rapid evolution in the expression of a gene involved in sex pheromone production in Drosophilid flies. Long-chain cuticular hydrocarbons (e.g., dienes) are produced female-specifically, notably via the activity of the desaturase DESAT-F, and are potent pheromones for male courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that across the genus Drosophila, the expression of this enzyme is correlated with long-chain diene production and has undergone an extraordinary number of evolutionary transitions, including six independent gene inactivations, three losses of expression without gene loss, and two transitions in sex-specificity. Furthermore, we show that evolutionary transitions from monomorphism to dimorphism (and its reversion) in desatF expression involved the gain (and the inactivation) of a binding-site for the sex-determination transcription factor, DOUBLESEX. In addition, we documented a surprising example of the gain of particular cis-regulatory motifs of the desatF locus via a set of small deletions. Together, our results suggest that frequent changes in the expression of pheromone-producing enzymes underlie evolutionary transitions in chemical communication, and reflect changing regimes of sexual selection, which may have contributed to speciation among Drosophila.},

abstract = {Sensory regions of neocortex are organized as arrays of vertical columns composed of cells that share similar response properties, with the orientation columns of the cat's visual cortex being the best known example. Interest in how sensitivity to different stimulus features first emerges in the columns and how this selectivity is refined by subsequent processing has fueled decades of research. A natural starting point in approaching these issues is anatomy. Each column traverses the six cortical layers and each layer has a unique pattern of inputs, intrinsic connections and outputs. Thus, it makes sense to explore the possibility of corresponding laminar differences in sensory function, that is, to examine relationships between morphology and physiology. In addition, to help identify general patterns of cortical organization, it is useful to compare results obtained from different sensory systems and diverse species. The picture that emerges from such comparisons is that each cortical layer serves a distinct role in sensory function. Furthermore, different cortices appear to share some common strategies for processing information but also have specialized mechanisms adapted for the demands of specific sensory tasks. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the impact of this temporal versatility and cellular specificity has been greater for basic science than clinical research, it is natural to ask whether the dynamic patterns of neural circuit activity discovered to be causal in adaptive or maladaptive behaviors could become targets for treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases. Here, we consider the landscape of ideas related to therapeutic targeting of circuit dynamics. Specifically, we highlight optical, ultrasonic, and magnetic concepts for the targeted control of neural activity, preclinical/clinical discovery opportunities, and recently reported optogenetically guided clinical outcomes.},

abstract = {Many colour maps provided by vendors have highly uneven perceptual contrast over their range. It is not uncommon for colour maps to have perceptual flat spots that can hide a feature as large as one tenth of the total data range. Colour maps may also have perceptual discontinuities that induce the appearance of false features. Previous work in the design of perceptually uniform colour maps has mostly failed to recognise that CIELAB space is only designed to be perceptually uniform at very low spatial frequencies. The most important factor in designing a colour map is to ensure that the magnitude of the incremental change in perceptual lightness of the colours is uniform. The specific requirements for linear, diverging, rainbow and cyclic colour maps are developed in detail. To support this work two test images for evaluating colour maps are presented. The use of colour maps in combination with relief shading is considered and the conditions under which colour can enhance or disrupt relief shading are identified. Finally, a set of new basis colours for the construction of ternary images are presented. Unlike the RGB primaries these basis colours produce images whereby the salience of structures are consistent irrespective of the assignment of basis colours to data channels.},

By combination of site-specific fluorescent labeling of the Shaker potassium channel protein with voltage clamping, this gating conformational change was measured in real time. During channel activation, a stretch of at least seven amino acids of the putative transmembrane segment S4 moved from a buried position into the extracellular environment. This movement correlated with the displacement of the gating charge, providing physical evidence in support of the hypothesis that S4 is the voltage sensor of voltage-gated ion channels.},

abstract = {The ATM protein kinase, mutations of which are associated with the human disease ataxia-telangiectasia, mediates responses to ionizing radiation in mammalian cells. Here we show that ATM is held inactive in unirradiated cells as a dimer or higher-order multimer, with the kinase domain bound to a region surrounding serine 1981 that is contained within the previously described 'FAT' domain. Cellular irradiation induces rapid intermolecular autophosphorylation of serine 1981 that causes dimer dissociation and initiates cellular ATM kinase activity. Most ATM molecules in the cell are rapidly phosphorylated on this site after doses of radiation as low as 0.5 Gy, and binding of a phosphospecific antibody is detectable after the introduction of only a few DNA double-strand breaks in the cell. Activation of the ATM kinase seems to be an initiating event in cellular responses to irradiation, and our data indicate that ATM activation is not dependent on direct binding to DNA strand breaks, but may result from changes in the structure of chromatin.},

abstract = {Little is known about the network structure of the central pattern generator (CPG) controlling locomotor movements in mammals. The present experiments aim at providing such knowledge by focusing on commissural interneurons (CINs) involved in left-right coordination. During NMDA and 5-HT-initiated locomotor-like activity, we recorded intracellularly from caudally or descending projecting L2 and L3 CINs (dCINs) located in the ventromedial area of the lumbar spinal cord in newborn rats. This region is crucial for rhythmic motor output and left-right coordination. The overall sample of dCINs represented a heterogenous population with neurons that fired in all phases of the locomotor cycle and exhibited varying degrees of rhythmicity, from strongly rhythmic to nonrhythmic. Among the rhythmic, putative CPG dCINs were populations that fired in-phase with the ipsilateral or with the contralateral L2 locomotor-like activity. There was a high degree of organization in the dorsoventral location of rhythmic dCINs, with neurons in-phase with the ipsilateral L2 activity located more ventrally. Spikes of rhythmically active dCINs were superimposed on membrane oscillations that were generated predominantly by synaptic input, with little direct contribution from the intrinsic pacemaker hyperpolarization-activated inward current. For both ipsilaterally and contralaterally firing dCINs the dominant synaptic drive was in-phase with the ipsilateral L2 motor activity. This study provides the first characterization of putative CPG interneurons in the mammalian spinal cord. Our results suggest an anatomical and physiological separation of CPG commissural interneurons in the ventral horn and demonstrate that it is possible to target specific interneuron subpopulations in the mammalian locomotor network.},

In dendrites visualized with two-photon laser scanning microscopy or electron microscopy, most of the GluR1-GFP was intracellular, mimicking endogenous GluR1 distribution. Tetanic synaptic stimulation induced a rapid delivery of tagged receptors into dendritic spines as well as clusters in dendrites.

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease and genetic as well as environmental factors play a role in its pathogenesis. Six different genes have been identified so far to be responsible for rare forms of autosomal dominant, early onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. All but one are transcription factors which influence expression of the other genes through the regulation of mRNA synthesis. These are hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4 alpha, HNF-1 alpha, insulin promoter factor (IPF)-1 and HNF-1 beta, which are associated with MODY1, 3, 4, 5 respectively. MODY1 is a relatively rare and usually severe form of diabetes. It is associated with progressive hyperglycemia and frequent chronic complications. The HNF-4 alpha gene is localized on chromosome 20q. Similar clinical characteristics apply to the MODY3 form, however the latter is much more frequent among early onset, autosomal dominant type 2 diabetes (20-40{\%}). HNF-1 alpha gene is localized on chromosome 12q. HNF-1 beta (MODY5 locus on chromosome 17q) is a protein which forms heterodimers with HNF-1 alpha. This rare form of diabetes has a clinical picture similar to MODY1 and MODY3. It is sometimes accompanied by symptoms of early kidney damage which are independent from diabetes. The other two transcription factors responsible for the development of autosomal dominant type 2 diabetes are proteins which bind directly to the insulin promoter. MODY4 (IPF-1, chromosome 13q) is a rare form and of a typical middle and late onset type 2 diabetes. BETA 2/Neurod1 has been recently associated with MODY by Dr Krolewski's group from Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA, USA. BETA 2 is responsible for about 2{\%} of autosomal dominant type 2 diabetes. The clinical characteristics depend on the localization of the mutations in the specific functional domains of the protein. Mutations identified in the glucokinase gene are associated with the MODY2 form. Glucokinase is an enzyme involved in the first level of glucose metabolism in b-cells-enzymatic phosphorylation. MODY2 is a modest form of diabetes. It is characterized by mild hyper-glycemia, mainly fasting, and the chronic complications are very rare. Glucokinase gene is localized on chromosome 7p. It is expected that in the nearest future more type 2 susceptibility genes will be identified.},

(2003) Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci., 358, 773-786.] These are that (i) activity-dependent synaptic plasticity plays a key role in the automatic encoding and initial storage of attended experience; (ii) the persistence of hippocampal synaptic potentiation over time can be influenced by other independent neural events happening closely in time, an idea with behavioural implications for memory; and (iii) that systems-level consolidation of memory traces within neocortex is guided both by hippocampal traces that have been subject to cellular consolidation and by the presence of organized schema in neocortex into which relevant newly encoded information might be stored. Hippocampal memory is associative and, to study it more effectively than with previous paradigms, a new learning task is described which is unusual in requiring the incidental encoding of flavour-place paired associates, with the readout of successful storage being successful recall of a place given the flavour with which it was paired. NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity is shown to be critical for the encoding and intermediate storage of memory traces in this task, while AMPA receptor-mediated fast synaptic transmission is necessary for memory retrieval. Typically, these rapidly encoded traces decay quite rapidly over time. Synaptic potentiation also decays rapidly, but can be rendered more persistent by a process of cellular consolidation in which synaptic tagging and capture play a key part in determining whether or not it will be persistent. Synaptic tags set at the time of an event, even many trivial events, can capture the products of the synthesis of plasticity proteins set in train by events before, during or even after an event to be remembered. Tag-protein interactions stabilize synaptic potentiation and, by implication, memory. The behavioural implications of tagging are explored. Finally, using a different protocol for flavour-place paired associate learning, it is shown that rats can develop a spatial schema which represents the relative locations of several different flavours of food hidden at places within a familiar space. This schema is learned gradually but, once acquired, enables new paired associates to be encoded and stored in one trial. Their incorporation into the schema prevents rapid forgetting and suggests that schema play a key and hitherto unappreciated role in systems-level memory consolidation. The elements of what may eventually mature into a more formal neurobiological theory of hippocampal memory are laid out as specific propositions with detailed conceptual discussion and reference to recent data.},

abstract = {Recent progress with optogenetic probes for imaging and manipulating neural activity has further increased the relevance of fiber-optic systems for neural circuitry research. Optical fibers, which bi-directionally transmit light between separate sites (even at a distance of several meters), can be used for either optical imaging or manipulating neural activity relevant to behavioral circuitry mechanisms. The method's flexibility and the specifications of the light structure are well suited for following the behavior of freely moving animals. Furthermore, thin optical fibers allow researchers to monitor neural activity from not only the cortical surface but also deep brain regions, including the hippocampus and amygdala. Such regions are difficult to target with two-photon microscopes. Optogenetic manipulation of neural activity with an optical fiber has the advantage of being selective for both cell-types and projections as compared to conventional electrophysiological brain tissue stimulation. It is difficult to extract any data regarding changes in neural activity solely from a fiber-optic manipulation device; however, the readout of data is made possible by combining manipulation with electrophysiological recording, or the simultaneous application of optical imaging and manipulation using a bundle-fiber. The present review introduces recent progress in fiber-optic imaging and manipulation methods, while also discussing fiber-optic system designs that are suitable for a given experimental protocol.},

Using representational fMRI analyses, we then examined how this hierarchical structure was reflected in the fine-grained brain activity patterns of the participants while they performed the 8 trained sequences. We found clear evidence of each level of the movement hierarchy at the representational level. However, anatomically, chunk and sequence representations substantially overlapped in the premotor and parietal cortices, whereas individual movements were uniquely represented in the primary motor cortex. The findings challenge the common hypothesis of an orderly anatomical separation of different levels of an action hierarchy and argue for a special status of the distinction between individual movements and sequential context.},

abstract = {The role of postsynaptic kinases in the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) was studied in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slice. A peptide inhibitor for the catalytic domain of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaM-kinase) was applied through a perfused patch pipette. The inhibitor completely blocked both the short-term potentiation and LTP induced by a pairing protocol. This indicates that the kinase or kinases affected by the peptide are downstream from depolarization in the LTP cascade. The ability to block LTP required that measures be taken to interfere with degradation of the peptide kinase inhibitor by endogenous proteases; either addition of protease inhibitors or modifications of the peptide itself greatly enhanced the effectiveness of the peptide. Protease inhibitors by themselves or control peptide did not block LTP induction. To study the effect of kinase inhibitor on LTP maintenance, we induced LTP in one pathway. Subsequent introduction of the kinase inhibitor blocked the induction of LTP in a second pathway, but it did not affect maintenance of LTP in the first. The implications for the role of kinases in LTP maintenance are discussed.},

abstract = {A previous study utilizing the powerful ipsilateral and weak crossed projection from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus in the rat revealed that long-term potentiation is an associative process in these systems. If the weak crossed projection alone receives potentiating stimulation consisting of 8 high-frequency trains 17.5 ms in duration, it does not exhibit long-term potentiation. However, long-term potentiation can be induced in the crossed projection if it is activated concurrently with the converging ipsilateral system. The present study is designed to determine the degree of synchrony required for the associative interactions by varying the timing and order of the potentiating trains delivered to the two converging systems. The associative induction of long-term potentiation does not require perfectly synchronous activation of the converging systems. The order of the trains is crucial, however. Long-term potentiation of the crossed projection can be induced if activity in the ipsilateral system is concurrent with or follows activity in the crossed projection. Indeed, there can be as much as 20ms between the 17.5ms trains in the two systems, and long-term potentiation of the crossed projection is still induced. Activation of the ipsilateral system that precedes activation of the crossed system depresses the responses evoked by the crossed system. If potentiating stimulation of the ipsilateral system follows activation of the crossed projection by too long an interval (200 ms, for example), then the crossed projection is depressed rather than potentiated. These results are discussed with regard to the nature of the associative process permissive for the induction of long-term potentiation and lead us to the conclusion that perfect temporal contiguity is not a requirement of this prototypical elemental memory unit.},

abstract = {The protooncogene c-fos is rapidly activated after noxious stimuli to express the protein Fos in spinal dorsal horn neurons that are in the 'correct' locations for nociceptive information transfer. As such, therefore, mapping Fos expression in these neurons is at present the best global marker for efficiently locating populations of neurons in the awake animal that respond to nociceptive input. This allows, among other things, precise behavioral measurements to be correlated with Fos expression. Two arenas where mapping dorsal horn Fos expression has made a major impact are in the anatomy of nociceptive systems and as a useful assay for the analgesic properties of various therapeutic regimens. Also Fos expression is the only way to map populations of neurons that are responding to non-localized input such as withdrawal after addiction and vascular occlusion. Another insight is that it shows a clear activation of neurons in superficial 'pain-processing' laminae by innocuous stimuli after nerve lesions, a finding that presumably bears on the allodynia that often accompanies these lesions. It is to be understood, however, that the Fos localizations are not sufficient unto themselves, but the major function of these studies is to efficiently locate populations of cells in nociceptive pathways so that powerful anatomic and physiologic techniques can be brought to bear efficiently. Thus, the purpose of this review is to summarize the studies whose numbers are geometrically expanding that deal with Fos in the dorsal horn and the conclusions therefrom. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Compromised neurocognition is a core feature of schizophrenia. Following Heinrichs and Zakzanis's (1998) seminal meta-analysis of middle-aged and predominantly chronic schizophrenia samples, the aim of this study is to provide a meta-analysis of neurocognitive findings from 47 studies of first-episode (FE) schizophrenia published through October 2007. The meta-analysis uses 43 separate samples of 2,204 FE patients with a mean age of 25.5 and 2,775 largely age- and gender-matched control participants. FE samples demonstrated medium-to-large impairments across 10 neurocognitive domains (mean effect sizes from -0.64 to -1.20). Findings indicate that impairments are reliably and broadly present by the FE, approach or match the degree of deficit shown in well-established illness, and are maximal in immediate verbal memory and processing speed. Larger IQ impairments in the FE compared to the premorbid period, but comparable to later phases of illness suggests deterioration between premorbid and FE phases followed by deficit stability at the group level. Considerable heterogeneity of effect sizes across studies, however, underscores variability in manifestations of the illness and a need for improved reporting of sample characteristics to support moderator variable analyses.},

abstract = {In animals with binocular vision, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons either cross or avoid the midline at the optic chiasm. Here, we show that ephrin-Bs in the chiasm region direct the divergence of retinal axons through the selective repulsion of a subset of RGCs that express EphB1. Ephrin-B2 is expressed at the mouse chiasm midline as the ipsilateral projection is generated and is selectively inhibitory to axons from ventrotemporal (VT) retina, where ipsilaterally projecting RGCs reside. Moreover, blocking ephrin-B2 function in vitro rescues the inhibitory effect of chiasm cells and eliminates the ipsilateral projection in the semiintact mouse visual system. A receptor for ephrin-B2, EphB1, is found exclusively in regions of retina that give rise to the ipsilateral projection. EphB1 null mice exhibit a dramatically reduced ipsilateral projection, suggesting that this receptor contributes to the formation of the ipsilateral retinal projection, most likely through its repulsive interaction with ephrin-B2.},

abstract = {The Reelin-signaling pathway regulates neuronal positioning during embryonic development. Reelin, the extracellular matrix protein missing in reeler mutants, is secreted by neurons in laminae I, II and V, binds to Vldl and Apoer2 receptors on nearby neurons, and tyrosine phosphorylates the adaptor protein Disabled-1 (Dab1), which activates downstream signaling. We previously reported that reeler and dab1 mutants had significantly reduced mechanical and increased heat nociception. Here we extend our analysis to chemical, visceral, and cold pain and importantly, used Fos expression to relate positioning errors in mutant mouse dorsal horn to changes in neuronal activity. We found that noxious mechanical stimulation-induced Fos expression is reduced in reeler and dab1 laminae I-II, compared to wild-type mice. Additionally, mutants had fewer Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the lateral-reticulated area of the deep dorsal horn than wild-type mice, a finding that correlates with a 50{\%} reduction and subsequent mispositioning of the large Dab1-positive cells in the mutant lateral-reticulated area. Furthermore, several of these Dab1 cells expressed Fos in wild-type mice but rarely in reeler mutants. By contrast, paralleling the behavioral observations, noxious heat stimulation evoked significantly greater Fos expression in laminae I-II of reeler and dab1 mutants. We then used the formalin test to show that chemical nociception is reduced in reeler and dab1 mutants and that there is a corresponding decrease in formalin-induced Fos expression. Finally, neither visceral pain nor cold-pain sensitivity differed between wild-type and mutant mice. As differences in the nociceptor distribution within reeler and dab1 mutant dorsal horn were not detected, these differential effects observed on distinct pain modalities suggest that dorsal horn circuits are organized along modality-specific lines. ?? 2012 IBRO.},

Here we gained by recombinant viruses selective genetic access to hypothalamic OT neurons to study their connectivity and control their activity by optogenetic means. We found axons of hypothalamic OT neurons in the majority of forebrain regions, including the central amygdala (CeA), a structure critically involved in OT-mediated fear suppression. Invitro, exposure to blue light of channelrhodopsin-2-expressing OT axons activated a local GABAergic circuit that inhibited neurons in the output region of the CeA. Remarkably, invivo, local blue-light-induced endogenous OT release robustly decreased freezing responses in fear-conditioned rats. Our results thus show widespread central projections of hypothalamic OT neurons and demonstrate that OT release from local axonal endings can specifically control region-associated behaviors. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

We have previously shown that precise mapping of thalamocortical projections requires both molecular cues and structured retinal activity. To probe the interaction between these two mechanisms, we studied mice deficient in both ephrin-As and retinal waves. Functional and anatomical cortical maps in these mice were nearly abolished along the nasotemporal (azimuth) axis of the visual space. Both the structure of single-cell receptive fields and large-scale topography were severely distorted. These results demonstrate that ephrin-As and structured neuronal activity are two distinct pathways that mediate map formation in the visual cortex and together account almost completely for the formation of the azimuth map. Despite the dramatic disruption of azimuthal topography, the dorsoventral (elevation) map was relatively normal, indicating that the two axes of the cortical map are organized by separate mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been applied to treat a number of neurological and psychiatric conditions, although its effects are transient and mediated by largely unknown mechanisms. Recently, optogenetic protocols that restore normal transmission at identified synapses in mice have provided proof of the idea that cocaine-adaptive behavior can be reversed in vivo. The most efficient protocol relies on the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluRs, which depotentiates excitatory synaptic inputs onto dopamine D1 receptor medium-sized spiny neurons and normalizes drug-adaptive behavior. We discovered that acute low-frequency DBS, refined by selective blockade of dopamine D1 receptors, mimics optogenetic mGluR-dependent normalization of synaptic transmission. Consequently, there was a long-lasting abolishment of behavioral sensitization.},

Similar to a prominent form of LTD observed in hippocampal slices, LTD in hippocampal cultures required NMDA receptor activation and was accompanied by a decrease in the amplitude and frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that induction of LTD caused a concurrent decrease in the number of AMPA receptors clustered at synapses but had no effect on synaptic NMDA receptor clusters. These results suggest that a subtype-specific redistribution of synaptic glutamate receptors contributes to NMDA receptor-dependent LTD.},

abstract = {Successful learning is often contingent on feedback. In instrumental conditioning, an animal or human learns to perform specific responses to obtain reward. Instrumental conditioning is often used by behavioral psychologists to train an animal (or human) to produce a desired behavior. Shaping involves reinforcing those behaviors, which in a stepwise manner are successively closer to the desired behavior until the desired behavior is reached. Here, we aimed to extend this traditional approach to directly shape neural activity instead of overt behavior. To achieve this, we scanned 22 human subjects with functional magnetic resonance imaging and performed image processing in parallel with acquisition. We delineated regions of interest (ROIs) in finger and toe motor/somatosensory regions and used an instrumental shaping procedure to induce a regionally specific increase in activity by providing an explicit monetary reward to reinforce neural activity in the target areas. After training, we found a significant and regionally specific increase in activity in the ROI being rewarded (finger or toe) and a decrease in activity in the nonrewarded region. This demonstrates that instrumental conditioning procedures can be used to directly shape neural activity, even without the production of an overt behavioral response. This procedure offers an important alternative to traditional biofeedback-based approaches and may be useful in the development of future therapies for stroke and other brain disorders.},

Here we introduce new approaches to quantify endogenous protein organization at single-molecule resolution in situ with super-resolution imaging by direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). Focusing on the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), we find that the AZ cytomatrix (CAZ) is composed of units containing {\~{}}137 Bruchpilot (Brp) proteins, three quarters of which are organized into about 15 heptameric clusters. We test for a quantitative relationship between CAZ ultrastructure and neurotransmitter release properties by engaging Drosophila mutants and electrophysiology. Our results indicate that the precise nanoscopic organization of Brp distinguishes different physiological AZ states and link functional diversification to a heretofore unrecognized neuronal gradient of the CAZ ultrastructure.},

We tested the hypothesis that plastic processes during wake lead to a net increase in synaptic strength and sleep is necessary for synaptic renormalization. We found that, in three Drosophila neuronal circuits, synapse size or number increases after a few hours of wake and decreases only if flies are allowed to sleep. A richer wake experience resulted in both larger synaptic growth and greater sleep need. Finally, we demonstrate that the gene Fmr1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) plays an important role in sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization.},

abstract = {Chemical warfare including insecticidal secondary metabolites is a well-known strategy for environmental microbes to monopolize a food source. Insects in turn have evolved behavioural and physiological defences to eradicate or neutralize the harmful microorganisms. We studied the defensive repertoire of insects in this interference competition by combining behavioural and developmental assays with whole-transcriptome time-series analysis. Confrontation with the toxic filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans severely reduced the survival of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. Nonetheless, the larvae did not behaviourally avoid the fungus, but aggregated at it. Confrontation with fungi strongly affected larval gene expression, including many genes involved in detoxification (e.g., CYP, GST and UGT genes) and the formation of the insect cuticle (e.g., Tweedle genes). The most strongly upregulated genes were several members of the insect-specific gene family Osiris, and CHK-kinase-like domains were over-represented. Immune responses were not activated, reflecting the competitive rather than pathogenic nature of the antagonistic interaction. While internal microbes are widely acknowledged as important, our study emphasizes the underappreciated role of environmental microbes as fierce competitors.},

abstract = {Brains are optimized for processing ethologically relevant sensory signals. However, few studies have characterized the neural coding mechanisms that underlie the transformation from natural sensory information to behavior. Here, we focus on acoustic communication in Drosophila melanogaster and use computational modeling to link natural courtship song, neuronal codes, and female behavioral responses to song. We show that melanogaster females are sensitive to long timescale song structure (on the order of tens of seconds). From intracellular recordings, we generate models that recapitulate neural responses to acoustic stimuli. We link these neural codes with female behavior by generating model neural responses to natural courtship song. Using a simple decoder, we predict female behavioral responses to the same song stimuli with high accuracy. Our modeling approach reveals how long timescale song features are represented by the Drosophila brain and how neural representations can be decoded to generate behavioral selectivity for acoustic communication signals. Clemens et al. study neural representations of courtship song in the Drosophila auditory system. By combining neural recordings, behavioral assays, and modeling, they show that females integrate song information and propose simple computations for predicting female behavior from single neuron responses.},

T1Rs are candidate mammalian taste receptors that combine to assemble two heteromeric G-protein-coupled receptor complexes: T1R1+3, an umami sensor, and T1R2+3, a sweet receptor. We now report the behavioral and physiological characterization of T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3 knockout mice. We demonstrate that sweet and umami taste are strictly dependent on T1R-receptors, and show that selective elimination of T1R-subunits differentially abolishes detection and perception of these two taste modalities. To examine the basis of sweet tastant recognition and coding, we engineered animals expressing either the human T1R2-receptor (hT1R2), or a modified opioid-receptor (RASSL) in sweet cells. Expression of hT1R2 in mice generates animals with humanized sweet taste preferences, while expression of RASSL drives strong attraction to a synthetic opiate, demonstrating that sweet cells trigger dedicated behavioral outputs, but their tastant selectivity is determined by the nature of the receptors.},

This situation looks certain to become worse with the rapidly increasing elderly population unless there is a wider adoption of best pain management practice. This paper reviews current knowledge of the development of chronic pain and the multidisciplinary team approach to pain therapy. The individual topics covered include nociceptive and neuropathic pain, peripheral sensitization, central sensitization, the definition and diagnosis of chronic pain, the biopsychosocial model of pain and the multidisciplinary approach to pain management. This last section includes an example of the implementation of a multidisciplinary approach in Belgium and describes the various benefits it offers; for example, the early multidimensional diagnosis of chronic pain and rapid initiation of evidence-based therapy based on an individual treatment plan. The patient also receives continuity of care, while pain relief is accompanied by improvements in physical functioning, quality of life and emotional stress. Other benefits include decreases in catastrophizing, self-reported patient disability, and depression. Improved training in pain management is clearly needed, starting with the undergraduate medical curriculum, and this review is intended to encourage further study by those who manage patients with chronic pain.},

abstract = {The way in which the central nervous system (CNS) governs animal movement is complex and difficult to solve solely by the analyses of muscle movement patterns. We tackle this problem by observing the activity of a large population of neurons in the CNS of larval Drosophila . We focused on two major behaviors of the larvae, forward and backward locomotion, and analyzed the neuronal activity related to these behaviors during fictive locomotion that spontaneously occurs in the isolated CNS. We expressed genetically-encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP, and a nuclear marker in all neurons and used digital scanned light-sheet microscopy to record neural activities in the entire ventral nerve cord at a fast frame rate. We developed image processing tools that automatically detect the cell position based on the nuclear staining and allocate the activity signals to each detected cell. We also applied a machine learning-based method that we developed recently to assign motor status in each time frame. Based on these methods, we find cells whose activity is biased to forward versus backward locomotion and vice versa. In particular, we identified a group of neurons near the boundary of subesophageal zone (SEZ) and thoracic neuromeres, which are strongly active during an early phase of backward but not forward fictive locomotion. Our experimental procedure and computational pipeline enable systematic identification of neurons to show characteristic motor activities in larval Drosophila .},

abstract = {NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation is required for many forms of learning and memory as well as sensory system receptive field plasticity, yet the relative contribution of presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDARs over cortical development remains unknown. Here we demonstrate a rapid developmental loss of functional presynaptic NMDARs in the neocortex. Presynaptic NMDARs enhance neurotransmitter release at synapses onto visual cortex pyramidal cells in young mice [before postnatal day 20 (P20)], but they have no apparent effect after the onset of the critical period for receptive field plasticity ({\textgreater}P23). Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the loss of presynaptic NMDAR function is likely attributable in part to a 50{\%} reduction in the prevalence of presynaptic NMDARs. Coincident with the observed loss of presynaptic NMDAR function, there is an abrupt change in the mechanisms of timing-dependent long-term depression (tLTD). Induction of tLTD before the onset of the critical period requires activation of presynaptic but not postsynaptic NMDARs, whereas the induction of tLTD in older mice requires activation of postsynaptic NMDARs. By demonstrating that both presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDARs contribute to the induction of synaptic plasticity and that their relative roles shift over development, our findings define a novel, and perhaps general, property of synaptic plasticity in emerging cortical circuits.},

Turning is rare on contact with retinal axons that are unable to induce collapse. In a separate series of experiments, dorsal root ganglion growth cones tend to turn away from beads coated with a brain extract enriched for the motility-inhibiting protein collapsin. Many turns are accomplished with filopodial contact alone. Growth cones do not turn away from control beads coated with heat-inactivated collapsin. These results suggest that inhibitory guidance cues can steer growth cones through a localized inhibition of lamellipodial protrusion.},

The extraordinary progress that has been made in the past few decades elucidating the underlying mechanisms of how long-term memories are formed has provided insight into how memories might also be enhanced. Capitalizing on this knowledge, it has been postulated that targeting many of the same mechanisms, including CREB activation, AMPA/NMDA receptor trafficking, neuromodulation (e.g., via dopamine, adrenaline, cortisol, or acetylcholine) and metabolic processes (e.g., via glucose and insulin) may all lead to the enhancement of memory. These and other mechanisms and/or approaches have been tested via genetic or pharmacological methods in animal models, and several have been investigated in humans as well. In addition, a number of behavioral methods, including exercise and reconsolidation, may also serve to strengthen and enhance memories. By utilizing this information and continuing to investigate these promising avenues, memory enhancement may indeed be achieved in the future.},

A form of homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD) has been described and widely studied in the CA1 region of the developing hippocampus in vitro. However, the relevance of this model of LTD to memory has been questioned because of failures to replicate it in the adult brain in vitro and, more recently, in vivo. Here we re-examine this important issue and find that homosynaptic LTD can in fact be elicited in the adult hippocampus in vivo, that it has all the properties described in immature CA1 in vitro, and that LTD and LTP are reversible modifications of the same Schaffer collateral synapses. Thus homosynaptic LTD is not peculiar to brain slices, nor is it only of developmental significance. Rather, out data suggest that the mechanisms of LTD and LTD may be equal partners in the mneumonic operations of hippocampal neural networks.},

abstract = {The growth-suppressive function of the retinoblastoma gene product, RB, has been ascribed to the underphosphorylated RB form that prevails during G1 phase in the cell cycle. We show that addition of the paracrine growth inhibitor transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) to Mv1Lu lung epithelial cells in mid to late G1 prevents phosphorylation of RB scheduled for this cell cycle stage and arrests cells in late G1. Expression of SV40 T antigen, a transforming protein that binds underphosphorylated RB, does not block the effect of TGF-beta 1 on RB phosphorylation but greatly reduces the growth-inhibitory response to TGF-beta 1. TGF-beta 1 and RB appear to function in a common growth-inhibitory pathway in which TGF-beta 1 acts to retain RB in the underphosphorylated, growth-suppressive state.},

Within the CNS, viral tracing techniques that rely on retrograde transsynaptic transfer provide a powerful tool for delineating circuit organization. Viral tracing of the circuits engaged by primary sensory neurons has, however, been hampered by the absence of a genetically tractable anterograde transfer system. In this study, we demonstrate that rabies virus can infect sensory neurons in the somatosensory system, is subject to anterograde transsynaptic transfer from primary sensory to spinal target neurons, and can delineate output connectivity with third-order neurons. Anterograde transsynaptic transfer is a feature shared by other classes of primary sensory neurons, permitting the identification and potentially the manipulation of neural circuits processing sensory feedback within the mammalian CNS. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The BDNF-induced chemo-attraction of axonal growth cones requires Ca2+ signalling, but how Ca2+ is regulated by BDNF at the growth cone remains largely unclear. Extracellular application of BDNF triggers membrane currents resembling those through TRPC (transient receptor potential canonical) channels in rat pontine neurons and in Xenopus spinal neurons. Here, we report that in cultured cerebellar granule cells, TRPC channels contribute to the BDNF-induced elevation of Ca2+ at the growth cone and are required for BDNF-induced chemo-attractive turning. Several members of the TRPC family are highly expressed in these neurons, and both Ca2+ elevation and growth-cone turning induced by BDNF are abolished by pharmacological inhibition of TRPC channels, overexpression of a dominant-negative form of TRPC3 or TRPC6, or downregulation of TRPC3 expression via short interfering RNA. Thus, TRPC channel activity is essential for nerve-growth-cone guidance by BDNF.},

Trunk and limb muscles engage in distinctly lateralized behaviors, yet how regulatory spinal circuitry differs is less clear. Here, we intersect virus technology and mouse genetics to unravel striking distribution differences of interneurons connected to functionallydistinct motor neurons. We find that premotor interneurons conveying information to axial motor neurons reside in symmetrically balanced locations while mostly ipsilateral premotor interneurons synapse withlimb-innervating motor neurons, especially those innervating more distal muscles. We show that observed distribution differences reflect specific premotor interneuron subpopulations defined by genetic and neurotransmitter identity. Synaptic input across the midline reaches axial motor neurons preferentially through commissural axon arborization, and to a lesser extent, through midline-crossing dendrites capturing contralateral synaptic input. Together, our findings provide insight into principles of circuit organization underlying weighted lateralization of movement.},

However, there has been no direct evidence reported for synapse loss in MDD, and the gene expression alterations underlying these effects have not been identified. Here we use microarray gene profiling and electron microscopic stereology to reveal lower expression of synaptic-function–related genes (CALM2, SYN1, RAB3A, RAB4B and TUBB4) in the dlPFC of subjects with MDD and a corresponding lower number of synapses. We also identify a transcriptional repressor, GATA1, expression of which is higher in MDD and that, when expressed in PFC neurons, is sufficient to decrease the expression of synapse-related genes, cause loss of dendritic spines and dendrites, and produce depressive behavior in rat models of depression.},

abstract = {The most distinctive attribute of long-term memory is persistence over time. New studies have uncovered many aspects of the molecular and cellular biology of synaptic plasticity, and the acquisition and consolidation of memory, which are thought to depend on synaptic plasticity. Much less, however, is known about the molecular and cellular biology of long-term memory persistence. Recent findings in the field are construed within the conceptual framework that proposes that consolidation and persistence of long-term memories require modulation of gene expression, which can culminate in synaptic remodeling. Whether modulation of gene expression, and particularly the ensuing morphological plasticity of the synapse, is permissive, causal or sufficient for the materialization and persistence of the long-term trace is, as yet, undetermined. How persistent is persistence? Renewed interest is focused on the possibility that some long-term memories consolidate anew with retrieval, and could, under certain conditions, become transiently shaky in this period of reconsolidation.},

abstract = {Detecting danger is one of the foremost tasks for a neural system. Larval parasitoids constitute clear danger to Drosophila, as up to 80{\%} of fly larvae become parasitized in nature. We show that Drosophila melanogaster larvae and adults avoid sites smelling of the main parasitoid enemies, Leptopilina wasps. This avoidance is mediated via a highly specific olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) type. While the larval OSN expresses the olfactory receptor Or49a and is tuned to the Leptopilina odor iridomyrmecin, the adult expresses both Or49a and Or85f and in addition detects the wasp odors actinidine and nepetalactol. The information is transferred via projection neurons to a specific part of the lateral horn known to be involved in mediating avoidance. Drosophila has thus developed a dedicated circuit to detect a life-threatening enemy based on the smell of its semiochemicals. Such an enemy-detecting olfactory circuit has earlier only been characterized in mice and nematodes.},

Through united efforts using electrophysiological and molecular genetic network approaches and behavioural studies in phylogenetically diverse experimental models, the organization of locomotor networks has begun to be decoded. The emergent themes from this research are that the locomotor networks have a modular organization with distinct transmitter and molecular codes and that their organization is reconfigured with changes to the speed of locomotion or changes in gait.},

Altering retinal activity can disrupt eye-specific segregation, but little is known about the temporal features of binocular activity that modulate visual map development. We used optogenetic techniques to directly manipulate retinal activity in vivo and identified a critical period before eye opening in mice when specific binocular features of retinal activity drive visual map development. Synchronous activation of both eyes disrupted segregation, whereas asynchronous stimulation enhanced segregation. The optogenetic stimulus applied was spatially homogenous; accordingly, retinotopy of ipsilateral projections was markedly perturbed, but contralateral retinotopy was unaffected or even improved. These results provide direct evidence that the synchrony and precise temporal pattern of binocular retinal activity during a critical period in development regulates eye-specific segregation and retinotopy in the developing visual system.},

abstract = {We show that a natural behavior, exploration of a novel environment, causes DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in neurons of young adult wild-type mice. DSBs occurred in multiple brain regions, were most abundant in the dentate gyrus, which is involved in learning and memory, and were repaired within 24 h. Increasing neuronal activity by sensory or optogenetic stimulation increased neuronal DSBs in relevant but not irrelevant networks. Mice transgenic for human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP), which simulate key aspects of Alzheimer's disease, had increased neuronal DSBs at baseline and more severe and prolonged DSBs after exploration. Interventions that suppress aberrant neuronal activity and improve learning and memory in hAPP mice normalized their levels of DSBs. Blocking extrasynaptic NMDA-type glutamate receptors prevented amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$)-induced DSBs in neuronal cultures. Thus, transient increases in neuronal DSBs occur as a result of physiological brain activity, and A$\beta$ exacerbates DNA damage, most likely by eliciting synaptic dysfunction.},

@article{Clustering2006,
abstract = {Spectrin is thought to mediate interactions between proteins and cellular membranes. Specifically, spectrin interacts directly with membranes via its phospholipid-binding PH domain. Spectrin is localized to plasma and other membranes at distinct sites in most cells, and may mediate specific protein-lipid complexes at each of these sites. In C. elegans , beta-spectrin is encoded by the unc-70 gene. To determine whether beta-spectrin is an essential protein-lipid mediator, we have generated animals that only express mutant forms of beta-spectrin in which the phospholipid-binding PH domain has been deleted (UNC-70 D PH). unc-70 null mutants are dumpy, paralyzed and have a severely disorganized nervous system. Surprisingly, UNC-70 D PH animals are not dumpy and do not have neuronal outgrowth defects. Further, antibody staining shows that UNC-70 D PH is normally localized. In contrast to several published models, these data indicate that the beta-spectrin PH domain is not required to localize UNC-70 and that this domain is not essential for many beta-spectrin functions. However, UNC-70 D PH animals are uncoordinated and hypersensitive to aldicarb, suggesting that the beta-spectrin PH domain is essential for limiting the release of synaptic vesicles from nerve terminals. Interestingly, these phenotypes are identical to the phenotypes of the dominant alleles of unc-70 . These mutations cause non-conservative substitutions in the 17 th spectrin repeat: near, but not in, the PH domain. Thus, the 17 th spectrin repeat and the PH domain seem to share a function. How are these mutations causing excess synaptic vesicle exocytosis? Both regions may be required for lipid binding, or both may be required for binding of a specific protein. To test the lipid-binding model, we are investigating retrograde transport in UNC-70 D PH animals. Beta-spectrin is thought to function in retrograde transport by linking the dynein/dynactin complex to cargo vesicles via its PH domain. Defects in retrograde transport could lead to the accumulation of synaptic vesicles or other components of release at the nerve terminal. We are using in vivo retrograde transport assays and genetic interactions to test for retrograde transport defects in UNC-70 D PH animals. As expected, these animals are not Dyf, demonstrating that retrograde transport of protein cargos does not require the beta-spectrin PH domain. Finally, we are generating point mutations in the PH domain that specifically abolish lipid binding. To test the protein-binding model, we are assessing how these mutations affect binding of the several proteins that are known to bind spectrin in this region. We are also testing whether these mutations cause changes in the distribution of synaptic vesicles by quantifying synaptic vesicle distribution in the dominant alleles by serial section electron microscopy. Together, these results should provide insight into how the beta-spectrin PH domain functions in synaptic vesicle release.},

@article{Saeed2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pain-related (nociceptive) information is carried from the periphery to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord mostly by two populations of small diameter primary afferents, the peptidergic and the non-peptidergic. The peptidergic population expresses neuropeptides, such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide, while the non-peptidergic fibers are devoid of neuropeptides, express the purinergic receptor P2X3, and bind the isolectin B4 (IB4). Although it has been known for some time that in rat the peptidergic afferents terminate mostly in lamina I and outer lamina II and non-peptidergic afferents in inner lamina II, the extent of the termination of the latter population in lamina I was never investigated as it was considered as very minor. Because our preliminary evidence suggested otherwise, we decided to re-examine the termination of non-peptidergic afferents in lamina I, in particular with regards to their innervation of projection neurons expressing substance P receptors (NK-1r). We used retrograde labeling of neurons from the parabrachial nucleus combined with lectin IB4 binding and immunocytochemistry. Samples were examined by confocal and electron microscopy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: By confocal microscopy, we studied the termination of non-peptidergic afferents in lamina I using IB4 binding and P2X3 immunoreactivity as markers, in relation to CGRP immunoreactivy, a marker of peptidergic afferents. The number of IB4 or P2X3-labeled fibers in lamina I was higher than previously thought, although they were less abundant than CGRP-labeled afferents. There were very few fibers double-labeled for CGRP and either P2X3 or IB4. We found a considerable number of IB4-positive fiber varicosities in close apposition to NK-1r-positive lamina I projection neurons, which were distinct from peptidergic varicosities. Furthermore, we confirmed at the ultrastructural level that there were bona fide synapses between P2X3-immunoreactive non-peptidergic boutons and neurokinin-1 receptor-positive lamina I dendrites.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate the presence of direct innervation by non-peptidergic nociceptive afferents of lamina I projection neurons expressing NK-1r. Further investigations are needed to better understand the role of these connections in physiological conditions and chronic pain states.},

In the ensuing years, scientists across the globe have sought to understand the mechanisms by which adrenal hormones and their synthetic analogues produce their complex and varied actions. Particular attention has focused on the glucocorticoids, partly because they have a vital place in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders but also because dysregulation of the secretion and/or activity of endogenous glucocorticoids is increasingly implicated in a number of common disorders that pose a growing clinical burden, such as obesity, type II diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, hypertension and depression. This review considers some of the key advances that have been made in our understanding of the physiology, pathology and pharmacology of the glucocorticoids. Emphasis is placed on the molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid signalling and the complex mechanisms that regulate the access of steroids in the systemic circulation to their receptors in their various target cells and tissues. In addition, consideration is given to the irreversible 'organisational' actions of glucocorticoids in perinatal life and to the potential role of the steroids in the aetiology of disease.},

abstract = {In Drosophila, we have found that some of the motor terminals in wandering third-instar larvae are sexually differentiated. In three out of the four body-wall muscle fibers that we examined, we found female terminals that produced a larger synaptic response than their male counterparts. The single motor terminal that innervates muscle fiber 5 produces an EPSP that is 69{\%} larger in females than in males. This is due to greater release of transmitter from female than male synaptic terminals because the amplitude of spon- taneous miniature EPSPs was similar in male and female muscle fibers. This sexual difference exists throughout the third-instar: it is seen in both early (foraging) and late (wandering) third-instar larvae. The sexual differen- tiation appears to be neuron specific and not muscle spe- cific because the same axon produces Is terminals on muscle fibers 2 and 4, and both terminals produce larger EPSCs in females than males. Whereas, the Ib terminals innervating muscle fibers 2 and 4 are not sexually differ- entiated. The differences in transmitter release are not due to differences in the size of the motor terminals. For the terminal on muscle fiber 5 and the Is terminal on muscle fiber 4, there were no differences in terminal length, the number of branches, or the number of synap- tic boutons in males compared to females. These sexual differences in neuromuscular synaptic physiology may be related to male-female differences in locomotion.},

More recent studies, however, have shown that the dendrites of many neurons are not passive, but contain active conductances. The role of these dendritic voltage-activated channels in the initiation of action potentials in neurons is largely unknown. To assess this directly, patch-clamp recordings were made from the dendrites of neocortical pyramidal cells in brain slices. Voltage-activated sodium currents were observed in dendritic outside-out patches, while action potentials could be evoked by depolarizing current pulses or by synaptic stimulation during dendritic whole-cell recordings. To determine the site of initiation of these action potentials, simultaneous whole-cell recordings were made from the soma and the apical dendrite or axon of the same cell. These experiments showed that action potentials are initiated first in the axon and then actively propagate back into the dendritic tree.},

This sense of proprioception relies on diverse populations of mechanosensory neurons distributed throughout the body. However, little is known about how proprioceptor neurons collectively encode sensory stimuli. Here, we investigate neural coding of leg proprioception in Drosophila , using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of proprioceptors during controlled movements of the fly tibia. We found that the axons of leg proprioceptors are organized into distinct functional projections that contain topographic representations of specific kinematic features. Using subtype-specific genetic driver lines, we show that one group of axons encodes tibia position (flexion/extension), another encodes movement direction, and a third encodes bidirectional movement and vibration frequency. Thus, proprioceptive sensing of a single leg joint is mediated by multiple subtypes of specialized sensory neurons. This architecture may help to maximize information transmission, processing speed, and robustness, which are critical for feedback control of the limbs during locomotion.},

abstract = {Nervous systems across the animal kingdom have the ability to select appropriate actions and sequences of actions in response to sensory cues. The circuit mechanisms by which nervous systems achieve choice, stability and transitions between behaviors are still incompletely understood. To identify neurons and brain areas involved in controlling these processes, we developed an approach where we combined a large-scale neuronal inactivation screen with an automated action detection of sensorimotor decisions and sequences in response to a sensory cue in Drosophila larva. We analyzed behaviors from 2.9x105 larvae and identified 51 candidate lines for sensory processing and 24 candidate lines for competitive interactions between actions during sensorimotor decisions. We also detected phenotype categories for sequence transitions consistent with a model of sequence generation where transitions and reversals are independently controlled. These findings provide the basis for understanding how sensorimotor decisions and sequence transition are controlled by the nervous system.},

abstract = {Background: Animals control the speed of motion to meet behavioral demands. Yet, the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that a class of segmentally arrayed local interneurons (period-positive median segmental interneurons, or PMSIs) regulates the speed of peristaltic locomotion in Drosophila larvae. Results: PMSIs formed glutamatergic synapses on motor neurons and, when optogenetically activated, inhibited motor activity, indicating that they are inhibitory premotor interneurons. Calcium imaging showed that PMSIs are rhythmically active during peristalsis with a short time delay in relation to motor neurons. Optogenetic silencing of these neurons elongated the duration of motor bursting and greatly reduced the speed of larval locomotion. Conclusions: Our results suggest that PMSIs control the speed of axial locomotion by limiting, via inhibition, the duration of motor outputs in each segment. Similar mechanisms are found in the regulation of mammalian limb locomotion, suggesting that common strategies may be used to control the speed of animal movements in a diversity of species.},

abstract = {Animal locomotion requires spatiotemporally coordinated contraction of muscles throughout the body. Here, we investigate how contractions of antagonistic groups of muscles are intersegmentally coordinated during bidirectional crawling of Drosophila larvae. We identify two pairs of higher-order premotor excitatory interneurons present in each abdominal neuromere that intersegmentally provide feedback to the adjacent neuromere during motor propagation. The two feedback neuron pairs are differentially active during either forward or backward locomotion but commonly target a group of premotor interneurons that together provide excitatory inputs to transverse muscles and inhibitory inputs to the antagonistic longitudinal muscles. Inhibition of either feedback neuron pair compromises contraction of transverse muscles in a direction-specific manner. Our results suggest that the intersegmental feedback neurons coordinate contraction of synergistic muscles by acting as delay circuits representing the phase lag between segments. The identified circuit architecture also shows how bidirectional motor networks could be economically embedded in the nervous system.},

abstract = {A major unanswered question concerning "pain" circuitry is the extent to which different populations of primary afferent nociceptor engage the same or different ascending pathways. In the present study, we followed the transneuronal transport of a genetically expressed lectin tracer, wheat germ agglutinin, in NaV1.8-expressing nociceptors of the nonpeptide class. We found that interneurons of lamina II are at the origin of the major ascending circuits targeted by the nonpeptide nociceptors. These interneurons contact lamina V projection neurons, which in turn predominantly target fourth-order neurons in the amygdala, hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and to a remarkable extent, the globus pallidus. These circuits differ greatly from the lamina I-based projection that is targeted by the peptide class of nociceptors. Our results indicate that parallel, perhaps independent pain pathways arise from different nociceptor classes and that motor as well as limbic targets predominate in the circuits that originate from the nonpeptide population.

abstract = {Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) offers a powerful means of forming and modifying neural circuits. Experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated its potential usefulness for functions as varied as cortical map development, sharpening of sensory receptive fields, working memory, and associative learning. Even so, it is unlikely that STDP works alone. Unless changes in synaptic strength are coordinated across multiple synapses and with other neuronal properties, it is difficult to maintain the stability and functionality of neural circuits. Moreover, there are certain features of early postnatal development (e.g., rapid changes in sensory input) that threaten neural circuit stability in ways that STDP may not be well placed to counter. These considerations have led researchers to investigate additional types of plasticity, complementary to STDP, that may serve to constrain synaptic weights and/or neuronal firing. These are collectively known as "homeostatic plasticity" and include schemes that control the total synaptic strength of a neuron, that modulate its intrinsic excitability as a function of average activity, or that make the ability of synapses to undergo Hebbian modification depend upon their history of use. In this article, we will review the experimental evidence for homeostatic forms of plasticity and consider how they might interact with STDP during development, and learning and memory.},

abstract = {Innate behaviors are often executed in concert with accompanying physiological programs. How this coordination is achieved is poorly understood. Mating behavior and the transfer of sperm and seminal fluid (SSFT) provide a model for understanding how concerted behavioral and physiological programs are coordinated. Here we identify a male-specific neural pathway that coordinates the timing of SSFT with the duration of copulation behavior in Drosophila. Silencing four abdominal ganglion (AG) interneurons (INs) that contain the neuropeptide corazonin (Crz) both blocked SSFT and substantially lengthened copulation duration. Activating these Crz INs caused rapid ejaculation in isolated males, a phenotype mimicked by injection of Crz peptide. Crz promotes SSFT by activating serotonergic (5-HT) projection neurons (PNs) that innervate the accessory glands. Activation of these PNs in copulo caused premature SSFT and also shortened copulation duration. However, mating terminated normally when these PNs were silenced, indicating that SSFT is not required for appropriate copulation duration. Thus, the lengthened copulation duration phenotype caused by silencing Crz INs is independent of the block to SSFT. We conclude that four Crz INs independently control SSFT and copulation duration, thereby coupling the timing of these two processes.},

abstract = {Ghrelin is a recently identified growth hormone (GH) secretogogue whose administration not only induces GH release but also stimulates food intake, increases adiposity, and reduces fat utilization in mice. The effect on food intake appears to be independent of GH release and instead due to direct activation of orexigenic neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. The effects of ghrelin administration on food intake have led to the suggestion that inhibitors of endogenous ghrelin could be useful in curbing appetite and combating obesity. To further study the role of endogenous ghrelin in appetite and body weight regulation, we generated ghrelin-deficient (ghrl(-/-)) mice, in which the ghrelin gene was precisely replaced with a lacZ reporter gene. ghrl(-/-) mice were viable and exhibited normal growth rates as well as normal spontaneous food intake patterns, normal basal levels of hypothalamic orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides, and no impairment of reflexive hyperphagia after fasting. These results indicate that endogenous ghrelin is not an essential regulator of food intake and has, at most, a redundant role in the regulation of appetite. However, analyses of ghrl(-/-) mice demonstrate that endogenous ghrelin plays a prominent role in determining the type of metabolic substrate (i.e., fat vs. carbohydrate) that is used for maintenance of energy balance, particularly under conditions of high fat intake.},

We have divided GABA cells in the rat frontal cortex into 3 groups, based on their firing characteristics: fast-spiking (FS) cells, late-spiking (LS) cells, and non-FS cells. Expression of calcium-binding proteins and peptides could be shown in separate groups of GABA cells in layers II/III and V of the frontal cortex: (1) parvalbumin cells, (2) somatostatin cells, (3) calretinin and/or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) cells [partially positive for cholecystokinin (CCK)] and (4) large CCK cells (almost negative for VIP/calretinin). Combining the physiological and chemical properties of morphologically diverse nonpyramidal cells allows division into several groups, including FS basket cells containing parvalbumin, non-FS somatostatin Martinotti cells with ascending axonal arbors, and non-FS large basket cells positive for CCK. These subtypes show characteristic spatial distributions of axon collaterals and the innervation tendency of postsynaptic elements. With synchronized activity induced by cortical excitatory or inhibitory circuits, firing patterns were also found to differ. Subtype-selective occurrence of electrical coupling, finding for potassium channel Kv3.1 proteins, and cholinergic and serotonergic modulation supports our tentative classification. To clarify the functional architecture in the frontal cortex, it is important to reveal the connectional characteristics of GABA cell subtypes and determine whether they are similar to those in other cortical regions.},

abstract = {Repeated stimulation of hippocampal neurons can induce an immediate and prolonged increase in synaptic strength that is called long-term potentiation (LTP)-the primary cellular model of memory in the mammalian brain. An early phase of LTP (lasting less than three hours) can be dissociated from late-phase LTP by using inhibitors of transcription and translation, Because protein synthesis occurs mainly in the cell body, whereas LTP is input-specific, the question arises of how the synapse specificity of late LTP is achieved without elaborate intracellular protein trafficking. We propose that LTP initiates the creation of a short-lasting protein-synthesis-independent 'synaptic tag' at the potentiated synapse which sequesters the relevant protein(s) to establish late LTP. In support of this idea, we now show that weak tetanic stimulation, which ordinarily leads only to early LTP, or repeated tetanization in the presence of protein-synthesis inhibitors, each results in protein-synthesis-dependent late LTP, provided repeated tetanization has already been applied at another input to the same population of neurons. The synaptic tag decays in less than three hours. These findings indicate that the persistence of LTP depends not only on local events during its induction, but also on the prior activity of the neuron.},

Prior work has established that the RHT is sufficient for entrainment, but has not shown whether it is necessary because it has not been possible to transect that pathway. The present study addresses this problem by employing knife cuts to sever the RHT in male hamsters. Three knife cut procedures were used and one of these succeeded in separating the SCN from the optic chiasm in 8 animals with limited damage to the chiasm and the SCN. The effectiveness of the RHT lesion was confirmed by cholera toxin-HRP histochemistry which demonstrated that the knife cuts eliminate the normal retinal innervation of the SCN while sparing projections to thalamic and tectal visual centers. In a light-dark cycle, the lesioned animals exhibit free-running rhythms indicating that the RHT is necessary for entrainment. A surprising observation is the presence of extensive axonal sprouting of retinal fibers in brains of animals with RHT lesions. The newly-formed axons grow extensively into the SCN, anterior hypothalamus and basal forebrain, but form anomalous axonal plexuses which have no evident function.},

Several procedures worked fairly well, whereas others performed rather poorly. Thus, the latter group of rules would appear to have little validity, particularly for data sets containing distinct clusters. Applied researchers are urged to select one or more of the better criteria. However, users are cautioned that the performance of some of the criteria may be data dependent.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Synchronous rhythms represent a core mechanism for sculpting temporal coordination of neural activity in the brain-wide network. This review focuses on oscillations in the cerebral cortex that occur during cognition, in alert behaving conditions. Over the last two decades, experimental and modeling work has made great strides in elucidating the detailed cellular and circuit basis of these rhythms, particularly gamma and theta rhythms. The underlying physiological mechanisms are diverse (ranging from resonance and pacemaker properties of single cells to multiple scenarios for population synchronization and wave propagation), but also exhibit unifying principles. A major conceptual advance was the realization that synaptic inhibition plays a fundamental role in rhythmogenesis, either in an interneuronal network or in a reciprocal excitatory-inhibitory loop. Computational functions of synchronous oscillations in cognition are still a matter of debate among systems neuroscientists, in part because the notion of regular oscillation seems to contradict the common observation that spiking discharges of individual neurons in the cortex are highly stochastic and far from being clocklike. However, recent findings have led to a framework that goes beyond the conventional theory of coupled oscillators and reconciles the apparent dichotomy between irregular single neuron activity and field potential oscillations. From this perspective, a plethora of studies will be reviewed on the involvement of long-distance neuronal coherence in cognitive functions such as multisensory integration, working memory, and selective attention. Finally, implications of abnormal neural synchronization are discussed as they relate to mental disorders like schizophrenia and autism.},

abstract = {Action Potential (APs) patterns of sensory cortex neurons encode a variety of stimulus features, but how can a neuron change the feature to which it responds? Here, we show that in vivo a spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) protocol-consisting of pairing a postsynaptic AP with visually driven presynaptic inputs-modifies a neurons' AP-response in a bidirectional way that depends on the relative AP-timing during pairing. Whereas postsynaptic APs repeatedly following presynaptic activation can convert subthreshold into suprathreshold responses, APs repeatedly preceding presynaptic activation reduce AP responses to visual stimulation. These changes were paralleled by restructuring of the neurons response to surround stimulus locations and membrane-potential time-course. Computational simulations could reproduce the observed subthreshold voltage changes only when presynaptic temporal jitter was included. Together this shows that STDP rules can modify output patterns of sensory neurons and the timing of single-APs plays a crucial role in sensory coding and plasticity.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00012.001.},

abstract = {Comparative analysis of multiple genomes in a phylogenetic framework dramatically improves the precision and sensitivity of evolutionary inference, producing more robust results than single-genome analyses can provide. The genomes of 12 Drosophila species, ten of which are presented here for the first time (sechellia, simulans, yakuba, erecta, ananassae, persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis and grimshawi), illustrate how rates and patterns of sequence divergence across taxa can illuminate evolutionary processes on a genomic scale. These genome sequences augment the formidable genetic tools that have made Drosophila melanogaster a pre-eminent model for animal genetics, and will further catalyse fundamental research on mechanisms of development, cell biology, genetics, disease, neurobiology, behaviour, physiology and evolution. Despite remarkable similarities among these Drosophila species, we identified many putatively non-neutral changes in protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and cis-regulatory regions. These may prove to underlie differences in the ecology and behaviour of these diverse species.},

abstract = {The development of orderly connections in the mammalian visual system depends on action potentials in the optic nerve fibers, even before the retina receives visual input. In particular, it has been suggested that correlated firing of retinal ganglion cells in the same eye directs the segregation of their synaptic terminals into eye-specific layers within the lateral geniculate nucleus. Such correlations in electrical activity were found by simultaneous recording of the extracellular action potentials of up to 100 ganglion cells in the isolated retina of the newborn ferret and the fetal cat. These neurons fired spikes in nearly synchronous bursts lasting a few seconds and separated by 1 to 2 minutes of silence. Individual bursts consisted of a wave of excitation, several hundred micrometers wide, sweeping across the retina at about 100 micrometers per second. These concerted firing patterns have the appropriate spatial and temporal properties to guide the refinement of connections between the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus.},

abstract = {This study evaluated Fos-like immunoreactivity in lumbar spinal cord neurons following intense cold stimulation and then the modifications induced by opioid administration. Under urethane anaesthesia, the rat's right foot was stimulated by holding it in a regulated temperature bath at 15, 10, 0, -10, -15, -17.5 or -20??C. There was no or little Fos-like immunoreactivity in lumbar spinal cord neurons when the paw was at temperatures between 15 and -10??C (0-5 Fos-like immunoreactive neurons/section). The threshold to induce consistent c-fos expression was -15??C. From -15 to -20??C, the number of Fos-like immunoreactive neurons increased with decreases in temperature. At -20??C, Fos-like immunoreactive neurons were numerous in L3 and L4 segments, in laminae I-II (???60 Fos-like immunoreactive neurons/section) and to a lesser extent in laminae V-VI (???20). Almost no Fos-like immunoreactivity was present in laminae III-IV ({\textless} 5). At -20??C, the number of Fos-like immunoreactive neurons increased with the duration of the stimulation. The number of Fos-like immunoreactive neurons induced by the cold stimulation temperatures was significantly decreased by pretreatment with 10 mg/kg s.c. morphine and moderately decreased by 5 mg/kg s.c. This effect was antagonized by the combined administration of morphine (10 mg/kg s.c.) and naloxone (2 mg/kg s.c.). Naloxone (2 mg/kg s.c.) significantly increased the number of Fos-like immunoreactive neurons induced by -20??C as compared to saline-injected rats. This study showed that Fos-like immunoreactivity distribution is in good agreement with the location of neurons receiving noxious inputs and that the threshold to induce c-fos expression with cold was unexpectedly low at -15??C. Taking into account, on the one hand, previous investigations using the same technique using noxious heat stimulation and, on the other hand, electrophysiological and psychophysiological studies using cold stimulation in animals and humans, our results suggest that Fos-like immunoreactivity induced by extremely cold stimulation, which seems to reproduce frostbite, may reflect activation of nociceptors due to vasoconstriction. ?? 1994.},

We found that circadian rhythms of behavior (locomotor activity), clock gene expression, and body temperature immediately reentrained to phase-shifted light-dark cycles in mice lacking vasopressin receptors V1a and V1b (V1a(-/-)V1b(-/-)). Nevertheless, the behavior of V1a(-/-)V1b(-/-) mice was still coupled to the internal clock, which oscillated normally under standard conditions. Experiments with suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) slices in culture suggested that interneuronal communication mediated by V1a and V1b confers on the SCN an intrinsic resistance to external perturbation. Pharmacological blockade of V1a and V1b in the SCN of wild-type mice resulted in accelerated recovery from jet lag, which highlights the potential of vasopressin signaling as a therapeutic target for management of circadian rhythm misalignment, such as jet lag and shift work.},

abstract = {Embryonic retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons must extend toward and grow through the optic disc to exit the eye into the optic nerve. In the embryonic mouse eye, we found that immunoreactivity for the axon guidance molecule netrin-1 was specifically on neuroepithelial cells at the disk surrounding exiting RGC axons, and RGC axons express the netrin receptor, DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer). In vitro, anti-DCC antibodies reduced RGC neurite outgrowth responses to netrin-1. In netrin-1- and DCC-deficient embryos, RGC axon pathfinding to the disc was unaffected; however, axons failed to exit into the optic nerve, resulting in optic nerve hypoplasia. Thus, netrin-1 through DCC appears to guide RGC axons locally at the optic disc rather than at long range, apparently reflecting the localization of netrin-1 protein to the vicinity of netrin-1-producing cells at the optic disc.},

abstract = {Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+ channels drives the production of the pro-inflammatory molecule leukotriene C4 (LTC4) from mast cells through a pathway involving Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2, phospholipase A2, and 5-lipoxygenase. Here we examine whether local Ca2+ influx through store-operated Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels in the plasma membrane stimulates this signaling pathway. Manipulating the amplitude and spatial extent of Ca2+ entry by altering chemical and electrical gradients for Ca2+ influx or changing the Ca2+ buffering of the cytoplasm all impacted on protein kinase C and ERK activation, generation of arachidonic acid and LTC4 secretion, with little change in the bulk cytoplasmic Ca2+ rise. Similar bulk cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations were achieved when CRAC channels were activated in 0.25 mm external Ca2+ versus 2 mm Ca2+ and 100 nm La3+, an inhibitor of CRAC channels. However, despite similar bulk cytoplasmic Ca2+, protein kinase C activation and LTC4 secretion were larger in 2 mm Ca2+ and La3+ than in 0.25 mm Ca2+, consistent with the central involvement of a subplasmalemmal Ca2+ rise. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk coupled CRAC channel opening to protein kinase C and ERK activation. Recombinant TRPC3 channels also activated protein kinase C, suggesting that subplasmalemmal Ca2+ rather than a microdomain exclusive to CRAC channels is the trigger. Hence a subplasmalemmal Ca2+ increase in mast cells is highly versatile in that it triggers cytoplasmic responses through generation of intracellular messengers as well as long distance changes through increased secretion of paracrine signals.},

This review outlines recent efforts using genetic approaches in the mouse to map the spinal cord circuits that transmit and gate the cutaneous somatosensory modalities of touch, pain, and itch. Recent studies have revealed an underlying modular architecture in which nociceptive, pruritic, and innocuous stimuli are processed by distinct molecularly deﬁned interneuron cell types. These include excitatory populations that transmit information about both innocuous and painful touch and inhibitory populations that serve as a gate to prevent innocuous stimuli from activating the nociceptive and pruritic transmission pathways. By dissecting the cellular composition of dorsal-horn networks, studies are beginning to elucidate the intricate computational logic of somatosensory transformation in health and disease.},

Such arrays are implanted into the patient's cortical tissue and record extracellular potentials from nearby neurons, allowing the information encoded by the neuronal discharges to control external devices. While such systems perform well during acute recordings, they often fail to function reliably in clinically relevant chronic settings. Available evidence suggests that a major failure mode of electrode arrays is the brain tissue reaction against these implants, making the biocompatibility of implanted electrodes a primary concern in device design. This review presents the biological components and time course of the acute and chronic tissue reaction in brain tissue, analyses the brain tissue response of current electrode systems, and comments on the various material science and bioactive strategies undertaken by electrode designers to enhance electrode performance. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This maturational program is mimicked by postsynaptic expression of constitutively active calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII).

By comparing the results of two consecutive samples, it decides the direction of movement, appearing as a turn proceeded by one or more head casts. Here by analyzing larval behavior in a light-spot-based phototaxis assay, we showed that, in addition to turns with a single cast (1-cast), turns with multiple head casts (n-cast) helped to improve the success of light avoidance. Upon entering the light spot, the probability of escape from light after the first head cast was only {\~{}}30{\%}. As the number of head casts increased, the chance of successful light avoidance increased and the overall chance of escaping from light increased to {\textgreater}70{\%}. The amplitudes of first head casts that failed in light avoidance were significantly smaller in n-cast turns than those in 1-cast events, indicating that n-cast turns might be planned before completion of the first head cast. In n-casts, the amplitude of the second head cast was generally larger than that of the first head cast, suggesting that larvae tried harder in later attempts to improve the efficacy of light avoidance. We propose that both 1-cast turns and n-cast turns contribute to successful larval light avoidance, and both can be initiated at the first head cast.},

abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT) is known to modulate motor outputs in a variety of animal behaviors. However, the downstream neural pathways of 5-HT remain poorly understood. We studied the role of 5-HT in directional change, or turning, behavior of fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) larvae. We analyzed light- and touch-induced turning and found that turning is a combination of three components: bending, retreating, and rearing. Serotonin transmission suppresses rearing; when we inhibited 5-HT neurons with Shibire or Kir2.1, rearing increased without affecting the occurrence of bending or retreating. Increased rearing in the absence of 5-HT transmission often results in slower or failed turning, indicating that suppression of rearing by 5-HT is critical for successful turning. We identified a class of abdominal neurons called the abdominal LK neurons (ABLKs), which express the 5-HT1B receptor and the neuropeptide leucokinin, as downstream targets of 5-HT that are involved in the control of turning. Increased rearing was observed when neural transmission or leucokinin synthesis was inhibited in these cells. Forced activation of ABLKs also increased rearing, suggesting that an appropriate level of ABLK activity is critical for the control of turning. Calcium imaging revealed that ABLKs show periodic activation with an interval of ∼15 s. The activity level of ABLKs increased and decreased in response to a 5-HT agonist and antagonist, respectively. Our results suggest that 5-HT modulates larval turning by regulating the activity level of downstream ABLK neurons and secretion of the neuropeptide leucokinin.},

Here we show, using larval zebrafish, that V2a interneurons represent an intrinsic source of excitation necessary for the normal expression of the locomotor rhythm. Acute and selective ablation of these interneurons increases the threshold of induction of swimming activity, decreases the burst frequency, and alters the coordination of the rostro-caudal propagation of activity. Thus, our results argue that V2a interneurons represent a source of excitation that endows the spinal circuit with the capacity to generate locomotion.},

A possible case of conservation between phyla is that of doublesex (dsx) from Drosophila and mab-3 (male abnormal 3) from Caenorhabditis elegans, genes related in sequence and some elements of function. mab-3 controls multiple aspects of male development, including sense organ formation in the tail and yolk transcription in the intestine, both similar to functions of dsx. Indeed, the male isoform of DSX can replace MAB-3 in C. elegans. Do related genes control sexual development in vertebrates, despite great differences in the biology of sex determination? We have identified several dsx-related genes in mouse and human. One, Dmrt1, appears to play a conserved role in vertebrate male gonad development. In humans, DMRT1 maps to a short interval required for testis differentiation. In all vertebrates examined, including mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles, Dmrt1 is expressed early in the genital ridge, in most cases with higher expression in future male gonads. A null mutation in murine Dmrt1 causes severe defects in testis differentiation, resembling those associated with human deletions removing the gene. Mutant females are unaffected. Other DM domain genes are expressed in embryonic gonad and are currently under study.},

The small number of neurons and excellent genetic tools make Drosophila larva an especially tractable model system in which to address this problem. We developed high throughput assays with which we can simultaneously expose more than 1,000 larvae per man-hour to precisely timed noxious heat, vibration, air current, or optogenetic stimuli. Using this hardware in combination with custom software we characterized larval reactions to somatosensory stimuli in far greater detail than possible previously. Each stimulus evoked a distinctive escape strategy that consisted of multiple actions. The escape strategy was context-dependent. Using our system we confirmed that the nociceptive class IV multidendritic neurons were involved in the reactions to noxious heat. Chordotonal (ch) neurons were necessary for normal modulation of head casting, crawling and hunching, in response to mechanical stimuli. Consistent with this we observed increases in calcium transients in response to vibration in ch neurons. Optogenetic activation of ch neurons was sufficient to evoke head casting and crawling. These studies significantly increase our understanding of the functional roles of larval ch neurons. More generally, our system and the detailed description of wild type reactions to somatosensory stimuli provide a basis for systematic identification of neurons and genes underlying these behaviors.},

abstract = {To better understand how organisms make decisions on the basis of temporally varying multi-sensory input, we identified computations made by Drosophila larvae responding to visual and optogenetically induced fictive olfactory stimuli. We modeled the larva's navigational decision to initiate turns as the output of a Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson cascade. We used reverse-correlation to fit parameters to this model; the parameterized model predicted larvae's responses to novel stimulus patterns. For multi-modal inputs, we found that larvae linearly combine olfactory and visual signals upstream of the decision to turn. We verified this prediction by measuring larvae's responses to coordinated changes in odor and light. We studied other navigational decisions and found that larvae integrated odor and light according to the same rule in all cases. These results suggest that photo-taxis and odor-taxis are mediated by a shared computational pathway.Living organisms can sense cues from their surroundings and respond in appropriate ways. For example, animals will often move towards the smell of food or away from potential threats, such as predators. However, it is not fully understood how an animal's nervous system is set up to allow sensory information to control how the animal navigates its environment. It is also not clear how animals ‘decide' what to do when they receive conflicting information from different senses.Optogenetics is a technique that allows neuroscientists to control the activities of individual nerve cells simply by shining light on to them. Fruit fly larvae have a simple but well-studied nervous system, and they are nearly transparent, so scientists can use optogenetics to activate nerve cells in freely moving larvae.Fruit fly larvae move in a series of forward ‘runs' and direction-changing ‘turns' and use sensory cues to decide when to turn, how large of a turn to make, and whether to turn left or right. Gepner, Mihovilovic Skanata et al. used optogenetics to stimulate different combinations of sensory nerve cells in larvae, while tracking the larvae's movements to discover exactly what information they used to make these decisions. An independent study by Hernandez-Nunez et al. also used a similar approach.Fruit fly larvae are attracted towards scents from rotting fruit and are repelled by light—in particular, larvae are most sensitive to blue light but cannot detect red light. Therefore, Gepner, Mihovilovic Skanata et al. could expose the larvae to blue light to activate light-sensing nerve cells as normal, and use red light to activate odor-sensing nerve cells via optogenetics. These experiments showed that larvae changed direction more often when the level of blue light was increased or when the level of red light (which simulated the detection of odors from rotting fruits) was decreased.Analysis of the data from these experiments revealed that larvae essentially assign negative values to the blue light and positive values to the ‘odor-mimicking' red light. The larvae then use the sum of these two values to dictate their next move. This suggests that navigation in response to both light and odors is supported by the same pathways in a larva's nervous system.The approach of using optogenetics in combination with quantitative analysis, as used in these two independent studies, is now opening the door to a more complete understanding of the connections between the activities of sensory nerve cells and perception and behavior.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia, autism and intellectual disabilities are best understood as spectrums of diseases that have broad sets of causes. However, it is becoming evident that these conditions also have overlapping phenotypes and genetics, which is suggestive of common deficits. In this context, the idea that the disruption of inhibitory circuits might be responsible for some of the clinical features of these disorders is gaining support. Recent studies in animal models demonstrate that the molecular basis of such disruption is linked to specific defects in the development and function of interneurons - the cells that are responsible for establishing inhibitory circuits in the brain. These insights are leading to a better understanding of the causes of schizophrenia, autism and intellectual disabilities, and may contribute to the development of more-effective therapeutic interventions.},

abstract = {Pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex span multiple cortical layers. How the excitable properties of pyramidal neuron dendrites allow these neurons to both integrate activity and store associations between different layers is not well understood, but is thought to rely in part on dendritic backpropagation of action potentials. Here we demonstrate that the sign of synaptic plasticity in neocortical pyramidal neurons is regulated by the spread of the backpropagating action potential to the synapse. This creates a progressive gradient between LTP and LTD as the distance of the synaptic contacts from the soma increases. At distal synapses, cooperative synaptic input or dendritic depolarization can switch plasticity between LTD and LTP by boosting backpropagation of action potentials. This activity-dependent switch provides a mechanism for associative learning across different neocortical layers that process distinct types of information. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Maximizing the potential of optogenetic approaches in deep brain structures of intact animals requires optical manipulation of neurons at high spatial and temporal resolutions, while simultaneously recording electrical data from those neurons. Here, we present the first fiber-less optoelectrode with a monolithically integrated optical waveguide mixer that can deliver multicolor light at a common waveguide port to achieve multicolor modulation of the same neuronal population in vivo. We demonstrate successful device implementation by achieving efficient coupling between a side-emitting injection laser diode (ILD) and a dielectric optical waveguide mixer via a gradient-index (GRIN) lens. The use of GRIN lenses attains several design features, including high optical coupling and thermal isolation between ILDs and waveguides. We validated the packaged devices in the intact brain of anesthetized mice co-expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 and Archaerhodopsin in pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region, achieving high quality recording, activation and silencing of the exact same neurons in a given local region. This fully-integrated approach demonstrates the spatial precision and scalability needed to enable independent activation and silencing of the same or different groups of neurons in dense brain regions while simultaneously recording from them, thus considerably advancing the capabilities of currently available optogenetic toolsets.},

abstract = {Male sexual behavior in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is regulated by fruitless (fru), a sex-determination gene specifying the synthesis of BTB-Zn finger proteins that likely function as male-specific transcriptional regulators. Expression of fru in the nervous system specifies male sexual behavior and the muscle of Lawrence (MOL), an abdominal muscle that develops in males but not in females. We have isolated the fru ortholog from the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae and show the gene's conserved genomic structure. We demonstrate that male-specific mosquito fru protein isoforms arise by conserved mechanisms of sex-specifically activated and alternative exon splicing. A male-determining function of mosquito fru is revealed by ectopic expression of the male mosquito isoform FRUMC in fruit flies; this results in MOL development in both fru-mutant males and fru+ females who otherwise develop no MOL. In parallel, we provide evidence of a unique feature of muscle differentiation within the fifth abdominal segment of male mosquitoes that strongly resembles the fruit fly MOL. Given these conserved features within the context of 250 Myr of evolutionary divergence between Drosophila and Anopheles, we hypothesize that fru is the prototypic gene of male sexual behavior among dipteran insects.},

Here, we report the identification of Rag GTPases as activators of TORC1 in response to amino acid signals. Knockdown of Rag gene expression suppressed the stimulatory effect of amino acids on TORC1 in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. Expression of constitutively active (GTP-bound) Rag in mammalian cells activated TORC1 in the absence of amino acids, whereas expression of dominant-negative Rag blocked the stimulatory effects of amino acids on TORC1. Genetic studies in Drosophila also show that Rag GTPases regulate cell growth, autophagy and animal viability during starvation. Our studies establish a function of Rag GTPases in TORC1 activation in response to amino acid signals.},

abstract = {A series of classical studies in non-human primates has revealed the neuronal activity patterns underlying decision-making. However, the circuit mechanisms for such patterns remain largely unknown. Recent detailed circuit analyses in simpler neural systems have started to reveal the connectivity patterns underlying analogous processes. Here we review a few of these systems that share a particular connectivity pattern, namely mutual inhibition of lateral inhibition. Close examination of these systems suggests that this recurring connectivity pattern (‘network motif') is a building block to enforce particular dynamics, which can be used not only for simple behavioral choice but also for more complex choices and other brain functions. Thus, a network motif provides an elementary computation that is not specific to a particular brain function and serves as an elementary building block in the brain.},

abstract = {The present experiments examined the effects of direct intracortical microinjections of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist 2-amino-5- phosphonovaleric acid directly into the insular cortex of rats, before or immediately after training of conditioned taste aversion and the water maze spatial learning task. In the first series of experiments animals received bilateral injections of 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid prior to taste aversion conditioning or spatial training. A strong disruptive effect was found in the acquisition of training tasks. To determine the possible involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the early post-training processes taking place in the cortex during both learning paradigms, in a second series of experiments, animals received bilateral 2-amino-5- phosphonovaleric acid microinjections 30, 60 or 120 min after the acquisition trial, and 15 min before the retention test. For spatial learning successive treatments were independently done either starting at the onset of the asymptotic phase of the learning curve, 0, 30 or 120 min after finishing the training session, as well as 15 min before the retention test trial. The conditioned taste aversion task remained sensitive to N-methyl-D-aspartate blockade during a period of at least 2 h after the first presentation of the gustatory stimulus, while in the case of the spatial learning task, a gradually decreasing effect was observed from the onset of the asymptotic phase onwards. Taken together, these results provide direct evidence for N- methyl-D-aspartate receptor involvement in cortical regulation of memory formation. Furthermore, our results suggest that in the same cortical region, a different time-course for the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate-dependent mechanisms occurs during the early formation of cortically mediated memories, depending on the particular behavioural task.},

abstract = {C-fos is a proto-oncogene that is expressed within some neurons following depolarization. The protein product, c-fos protein, can be identified by immunohistochemical techniques. Therefore, c-fos expression might be used as a marker for neuronal activity throughout the neuraxis following peripheral stimulation. This study has analyzed patterns of c-fos expression in both control and anesthetized animals and in anesthetized rats subjected to various forms of peripheral stimulation. Labeled cells were counted in the spinal cord, brainstem, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Little c-fos immunoreactivity was found in control animals. Prolonged inhalational anesthesia increased the number of labeled cells at several brainstem sites. Noxious stimulation of anesthetized rats induced c-fos within the neuraxis in patterns consistent with data obtained from electrophysiological studies and in additional locations for which few direct electrophysiological data are available, such as the ventrolateral medulla, the posterior hypothalamic nucleus, and the reuniens and paraventricular thalamic nuclei. Gentle mechanical stimulation was ineffective in inducing c-fos-like protein. The data suggest that c-fos can be used as a transynaptic marker for neuronal activity following noxious stimulation. However, c-fos is expressed only in some kinds of neurons following peripheral stimulation, and it therefore may be an incomplete marker for nociresponsive activity. In addition, at least a few neurons express c-fos protein in the absence of noxious stimulation. Experiments analyzing c-fos expression must be designed with care, as both extraneous stimuli and anesthetic depth influence the results.},

abstract = {A multibranched hierarchy of regulatory genes controls all aspects of somatic sexual development in Drosophila melanogaster. One branch of this hierarchy is headed by the fruitless (fru) gene and functions in the central nervous system, where it is necessary for male courtship behavior as well as the differentiation of a male-specific abdominal structure, the muscle of Lawrence (MOL). A preliminary investigation of several of the mutations described here showed that the fru gene also has a sex-nonspecific vital function. The fru gene produces a complex set of transcripts through the use of four promoters and alternative splicing. Only the primary transcripts produced from the most distal (P1) promoter are sex-specifically spliced under direction of the sex-determination hierarchy. We have analyzed eight new fru mutations, created by X-ray mutagenesis and P-element excision, to try to gain insight into the relationship of specific transcript classes to specific fru functions. Males that lack the P1-derived fru transcripts show a complete absence of sexual behavior, but no other defects besides the loss of the MOL. Both males and females that have reduced levels of transcripts from the P3 promoter develop into adults but frequently die after failing to eclose. Analysis of the morphology and behavior of adult escapers showed that P3-encoded functions are required for the proper differentiation and eversion of imaginal discs. Furthermore, the reduction in the size of the neuromuscular junctions on abdominal muscles in these animals suggests that one of fru's sex-nonspecific functions involves general aspects of neuronal differentiation. In mutants that lack all fru transcripts as well as a small number of adjacent genes, animals die at an early pupal stage, indicating that fru's function is required only during late development. Thus, fru functions both in the sex-determination regulatory hierarchy to control male sexual behavior through sex-specific transcripts and sex-nonspecifically to control the development of imaginal discs and motorneuronal synapses during adult development through sex-nonspecific transcript classes.},

abstract = {Voltage-dependent movement of a sodium channel S4 segment was examined by cysteine scanning mutagenesis and testing accessibility of the residues to hydrophilic cysteine-modifying reagents. These experiments indicate that 2 charged S4 residues move completely from an internally accessible to an externally accessible location in response to depolarization by passage through a short 'channel' in the protein. The energetic problems of S4 movement have thus been solved in the same way that many ion channels achieve highly selective and rapid ion permeation through an open pore, by restricting the contact region between the permion and its channel.},

abstract = {Controversy exists regarding the site of modification of synaptic transmission during long-term plasticity in the mammalian hippocampus. Here we used a fluorescent marker of presynaptic activity, FM 1-43, to directly image changes in presynaptic function during both short-term and long-term forms of plasticity at presynaptic boutons of CA3-CA1 excitatory synapses in acute hippocampal slices. We demonstrated enhanced presynaptic function during long-term potentiation (LTP) induced either chemically (with tetraethylammonium), or by high-frequency (200-Hz) electrical stimulation. Both of these forms of LTP required activation of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels and NMDA receptors in the postsynaptic CA1 neuron. These results thus implied that a long-lasting increase in the efficacy of synaptic transmission is likely to depend, at least in part, on enhanced transmitter release from the presynaptic neuron.},

abstract = {Ion channels formed by the TRP (transient receptor potential) superfamily of proteins act as sensors for temperature, osmolarity, mechanical stress and taste. The growth cones of developing axons are responsible for sensing extracellular guidance factors, many of which trigger Ca2+ influx at the growth cone; however, the identity of the ion channels involved remains to be clarified. Here, we report that TRP-like channel activity exists in the growth cones of cultured Xenopus neurons and can be modulated by exposure to netrin-1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, two chemoattractants for axon guidance. Whole-cell recording from growth cones showed that netrin-1 induced a membrane depolarization, part of which remained after all major voltage-dependent channels were blocked. Furthermore, the membrane depolarization was sensitive to blockers of TRP channels. Pharmacological blockade of putative TRP currents or downregulation of Xenopus TRP-1 (xTRPC1) expression with a specific morpholino oligonucleotide abolished the growth-cone turning and Ca2+ elevation induced by a netrin-1 gradient. Thus, TRPC currents reflect early events in the growth cone's detection of some extracellular guidance signals, resulting in membrane depolarization and cytoplasmic Ca2+ elevation that mediates the turning of growth cones.},

abstract = {Andersen syndrome (AS) is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by periodic paralysis, long QT (LQT) with ventricular arrhythmias, and skeletal developmental abnormalities. We recently established that AS is caused by mutations in KCNJ2, which encodes the inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir2.1. In this report, we characterized the functional consequences of three novel and seven previously described KCNJ2 mutations using a two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique and correlated the findings with the clinical phenotype. All mutations resulted in loss of function and dominant-negative suppression of Kir2.1 channel function. In mutation carriers, the frequency of periodic paralysis was 64{\%} and dysmorphic features 78{\%}. LQT was the primary cardiac manifestation, present in 71{\%} of KCNJ2 mutation carriers, with ventricular arrhythmias present in 64{\%}. While arrhythmias were common, none of our subjects suffered sudden cardiac death. To gain insight into the mechanism of arrhythmia susceptibility, we simulated the effect of reduced Kir2.1 using a ventricular myocyte model. A reduction in Kir2.1 prolonged the terminal phase of the cardiac action potential, and in the setting of reduced extracellular K(+), induced Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger-dependent delayed afterdepolarizations and spontaneous arrhythmias. These findings suggest that the substrate for arrhythmia susceptibility in AS is distinct from the other forms of inherited LQT syndrome.},

abstract = {Action selection is a prerequisite for decision-making and a fundamental aspect to any goal-directed locomotion; it requires integration of sensory signals and internal states to translate them into action sequences. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral analysis to study neural circuits and mechanisms underlying action selection and decision-making in freely moving Drosophila. We discovered preferred patterns of motor activity and turning behavior. These patterns are impaired in FoxP mutant flies, which present an altered temporal organization of motor actions and turning behavior, reminiscent of indecisiveness. Then, focusing on central complex (CX) circuits known to integrate different sensory modalities and controlling premotor regions, we show that action sequences and turning behavior are regulated by dopamine D1-like receptor (Dop1R1) signaling. Dop1R1 inputs onto CX columnar ellipsoid body-protocerebral bridge gall (E-PG) neuron and ellipsoid body (EB) R2/R4m ring neuron circuits both negatively gate motor activity but inversely control turning behavior. Although flies deficient of D1 receptor signaling present normal turning behavior despite decreased activity, restoring Dop1R1 level in R2/R4m-specific circuitry affects the temporal organization of motor actions and turning. We finally show EB R2/R4m neurons are in contact with E-PG neurons that are thought to encode body orientation and heading direction of the fly. These findings suggest that Dop1R1 signaling in E-PG and EB R2/4 m circuits are compared against each other, thereby modulating patterns of activity and turning behavior for goal-directed locomotion. Kottler et al. use a novel behavioral paradigm to show that dopamine D1-like receptor Dop1R1 signaling in columnar E-PG and ellipsoid body R2/R4m ring neurons mediate temporal patterns of activity and inversely control turning, suggesting that Dop1R1 levels between interconnected central complex circuitry modulate behavioral performance in flies.},

abstract = {Summary Parabiosis of obese (ob/ob) with diabetes (db2J/db2J) mice caused the obese partner to become hypoglycemic, to lose weight and to die of starvation, while no abnormal changes were observed in the diabetes partner. The striking similarity of this response to that observed in normal mice in parabiosis with diabetes mice suggests that obese mice are like normal mice in having normal satiety centers sensitive to the satiety factor produced by the diabetes partner. In contrast, parabiosis of obese with normal mice is a fully viable combination suggesting that the obese partner does not produce sufficient satiety factor to turn off the normal partner's eating drive. However, obese mice in parabiosis with normal mice gain weight less rapidly and eat less than obese mice in parabiosis with obese mice. These observations suggest that some humoral factor is provided by the normal partner that regulates food consumption in the obese partner. To explain the identical obese-hyperglycemic syndromes produced by these two unrelated and separate genes when on identical genetic backgrounds, it is postulated that the obese mouse is unable to produce sufficient satiety factor to regulate its food consumption, whereas the diabetes mouse produces satiety factor, but cannot respond to it because of a defective satiety center.},

abstract = {Compared with laboratory environments, complex natural environments promote brain cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Predators are one important feature of many natural environments, but, in the laboratory, predatory stimuli tend to inhibit brain cell proliferation. Often, laboratory predatory stimuli also elevate plasma glucocorticoids, which can then reduce brain cell proliferation. However, it is unknown how natural predators affect cell proliferation or whether glucocorticoids mediate the neurogenic response to natural predators. We examined brain cell proliferation in six populations of the electric fish, Brachyhypopomus occidentalis, exposed to three forms of predator stimuli: (i) natural variation in the density of predatory catfish; (ii) tail injury, presumably from predation attempts; and (iii) the acute stress of capture. Populations with higher predation pressure had lower density of proliferating (PCNAþ) cells, and fish with injured tails had lower proliferating cell density than those with intact tails. However, plasma cortisol did not vary at the population level according to predation pressure or at the individual level according to tail injury. Capture stress significantly increased cortisol, but only marginally decreased cell proliferation. Thus, it appears that the presence of natural predators inhibits brain cell proliferation, but not via mechanisms that depend on changes in basal cortisol levels. This study is the first demonstration of predator-induced alteration of brain cell proliferation in a free-living vertebrate.},

abstract = {Growing axons encounter multiple guidance cues, but it is unclear how separate signals are resolved and integrated into coherent instructions for growth cone navigation. We report that glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored ephrin-As function as "reverse" signaling receptors for motor axons when contacted by transmembrane EphAs present in the dorsal limb. Ephrin-A receptors are thought to depend on transmembrane coreceptors for transmitting signals intracellularly. We show that the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret is required for motor axon attraction mediated by ephrin-A reverse signaling. Ret also mediates GPI-anchored GFR$\alpha$1 signaling in response to GDNF, a diffusible chemoattractant in the limb, indicating that Ret is a multifunctional coreceptor for guidance molecules. Axons respond synergistically to coactivation by GDNF and EphA ligands, and these cooperative interactions are gated by GFR$\alpha$1 levels. Our studies uncover a hierarchical GPI-receptor signaling network that is constructed from combinatorial components and integrated through Ret using ligand coincidence detection. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Synaptic circuits bind together functional modules of the neocortex. We aim to clarify in a rodent model how intra- and transcolumnar microcircuits in the barrel cortex are laid out to segregate and also integrate sensory information. The primary somatosensory (barrel) cortex of rodents is the ideal model system to study these issues because there, the tactile information derived from the large facial whiskers on the snout is mapped onto so called barrel-related columns which altogether form an isomorphic map of the sensory periphery. This allows to functionally interpret the synaptic microcircuits we have been analyzing in barrel-related columns by means of whole-cell recordings, biocytin filling and mapping of intracortical functional connectivity with sublaminar specificity by computer-controlled flash-release of glutamate. We find that excitatory spiny neurons (spiny stellate, star pyramidal, and pyramidal cells) show a layer-specific connectivity pattern on top of which further cell type-specific circuits can be distinguished. The main features are: (a) strong intralaminar, intracolumnar connections are established by all types of excitatory neurons with both, excitatory and (except for layer Vb- intrinsically burst-spiking-pyramidal cells) inhibitory cells; (b) effective translaminar, intracolumnar connections become more abundant along the three main layer compartments of the canonical microcircuit, and (c) extensive transcolumnar connectivity is preferentially found in specific cell types in each of the layer compartments of a barrel-related column. These multiple sequential and parallel circuits are likely to be suitable for specific cortical processing of "what" "where" and "when" aspects of tactile information acquired by the whiskers on the snout.},

abstract = {Innate behaviors involve both reflexive motor programs and enduring internal states, but how these responses are coordinated by the brain is not clear. In Drosophila, male-specific P1 interneurons promote courtship song, as well as a persistent internal state that prolongs courtship and enhances aggressiveness. However, P1 neurons themselves are not persistently active. Here, we identify pCd neurons as persistently active, indirect P1 targets that are required for P1-evoked persistent courtship and aggression. Acute activation of pCd neurons alone is inefficacious but enhances and prolongs courtship or aggression promoted by female cues. Brief female exposure induces a persistent increase in male aggressiveness, an effect abrogated by interruption of pCd activity. pCd activity is not sufficient but necessary for persistent physiological activity, implying an essential role in a persistence network. Thus, P1 neurons coordinate both command-like control of courtship song and a persistent internal state of social arousal mediated by pCd neurons.},

abstract = {childhood with aggression later in life, includ- ing physical assaults and spouse abuse. Because extremely violent criminal behaviors (e.g., forcible rape, aggravated as- sault, homicide) are rare, new longitudinal studies with larger samples are needed to estimate accurately how much habitual childhood exposure to media violence increases the risk for extreme violence. Well-supported theory delineates why and when exposure to media violence increases aggression and violence. Media violence produces short-term increases by priming existing aggressive scripts and cognitions, increasing physiological arousal, and triggering an automatic tendency to imitate ob- served behaviors. Media violence produces long-term effects via several types of learning processes leading to the acquisi- tion of lasting (and automatically accessible) aggressive scripts, interpretational schemas, and aggression-supporting beliefs about social behavior, and by reducing individuals' normal negative emotional responses to violence (i.e., desen- sitization). Certain characteristics of viewers (e.g., identification with aggressive characters), social environments (e.g., parental in- fluences), and media content (e.g., attractiveness of the per- petrator) can influence the degree to which media violence affects aggression, but there are some inconsistencies in re- search results. This research also suggests some avenues for preventive intervention (e.g., parental supervision, interpreta- tion, and control of children's media use). However, extant re- search on moderators suggests that no one is wholly immune to the effects of media violence. Recent surveys reveal an extensive presence of violence in modern media. Furthermore, many children and youth spend an inordinate amount of time consuming violent media. Al- though it is clear that reducing exposure to media violence will reduce aggression and violence, it is less clear what sorts of interventions will produce a reduction in exposure. The sparse research literature suggests that counterattitudinal and parental-mediation interventions are likely to yield bene- ficial effects, but that media literacy interventions by them- selves are unsuccessful. Though the scientific debate over whether media violence increases aggression and violence is essentially over, several critical tasks remain. Additional laboratory and field studies are needed for a better understanding of underlying psycholog- ical processes, which eventually should lead to more effective interventions. Large-scale longitudinal studies would help specify the magnitude of media-violence effects on the most se- vere types of violence. Meeting the larger societal challenge of providing children and youth with a much healthier media diet may prove to be more difficult and costly, especially if the sci- entific, news, public policy, and entertainment communities fail to educate the general public about the real risks of media-vio- lence exposure to children and youth},

Chrimson's excitation spectrum is red shifted by 45 nm relative to previous channelrhodopsins and can enable experiments in which red light is preferred. We show minimal visual system-mediated behavioral interference when using Chrimson in neurobehavioral studies in Drosophila melanogaster. Chronos has faster kinetics than previous channelrhodopsins yet is effectively more light sensitive. Together these two reagents enable two-color activation of neural spiking and downstream synaptic transmission in independent neural populations without detectable cross-talk in mouse brain slice.},

abstract = {Topographic order in the rat retinocollicular projection emerges from an initially diffuse projection during an early postnatal remodeling period that is coincident with the period of naturally occurring ganglion cell death. Here, we examine the relationship between a retinal axon's position along the medial-lateral axis as it enters the superior colliculus (SC) and its ability to form an appropriately positioned arbor and survive the remodeling period. At E18-E19, prior to map remodeling, axons labeled with focal DiI injections in the periphery of temporal, nasal, superior or inferior retina are widespread along the medial-lateral SC axis. At P12, after remodeling, the distributions of axons remain widespread over the medial-lateral SC axis relative to the positioning of their terminal arborizations, and resemble the distributions labeled at E18-E19, with the exception that the small proportion of axons most widely mispositioned along the medial-lateral SC axis are less frequent. These data indicate that the most widely mispositioned retinal axons are preferentially eliminated, but that a high proportion of retinal axons mispositioned along the medial-lateral axis as they enter the SC can correct their position, form topographically appropriate arbors, and survive the remodeling period.},

abstract = {Stimulation of cells with physiological concentrations of calcium-mobilizing agonists often results in the generation of repetitive cytoplasmic Ca(2+) oscillations. Although oscillations arise from regenerative Ca(2+) release, they are sustained by store-operated Ca(2+) entry through Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels. Here, we show that following stimulation of cysteinyl leukotriene type I receptors in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-1 cells, large amplitude Ca(2+) oscillations, CRAC channel activity, and downstream Ca(2+)-dependent nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-driven gene expression are all exclusively maintained by the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) sensor stromal interaction molecule (STIM) 1. However, stimulation of tyrosine kinase-coupled FC$\epsilon$RI receptors evoked Ca(2+) oscillations and NFAT-dependent gene expression through recruitment of both STIM2 and STIM1. We conclude that different agonists activate different STIM proteins to sustain Ca(2+) signals and downstream responses.},

abstract = {Summary Behavioral persistence is a major factor in determining when and under which circumstances animals will terminate their current activity and transition into more profitable, appropriate, or urgent behavior. We show that, for the first 5 min of copulation in Drosophila, stressful stimuli do not interrupt mating, whereas 10 min later, even minor perturbations are sufficient to terminate copulation. This decline in persistence occurs as the probability of successful mating increases and is promoted by approximately eight sexually dimorphic, GABAergic interneurons of the male abdominal ganglion. When these interneurons were silenced, persistence increased and males copulated far longer than required for successful mating. When these interneurons were stimulated, persistence decreased and copulations were shortened. In contrast, dopaminergic neurons of the ventral nerve cord promote copulation persistence and extend copulation duration. Thus, copulation duration in Drosophila is a product of gradually declining persistence controlled by opposing neuronal populations using conserved neurotransmission systems. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Bilaterally symmetric motor patterns-those in which left-right pairs of muscles contract synchronously and with equal amplitude (such as breathing, smiling, whisking, and locomotion)-are widespread throughout the animal kingdom. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the underlying neural circuits. We performed a thermogenetic screen to identify neurons required for bilaterally symmetric locomotion in Drosophila larvae and identified the evolutionarily conserved Even-skipped+ interneurons (Eve/Evx). Activation or ablation of Eve+ interneurons disrupted bilaterally symmetric muscle contraction amplitude, without affecting the timing of motor output. Eve+ interneurons are not rhythmically active and thus function independently of the locomotor CPG. GCaMP6 calcium imaging of Eve+ interneurons in freely moving larvae showed left-right asymmetric activation that correlated with larval behavior. TEM reconstruction of Eve+ interneuron inputs and outputs showed that the Eve+ interneurons are at the core of a sensorimotor circuit capable of detecting and modifying body wall muscle contraction. During symmetrical motor activities-e.g., breathing, whisking, and hopping-bilateral pairs of muscles contract synchronously and with equal amplitude. Heckscher et al. identify the evolutionarily conserved Eve+ interneurons as part of a sensorimotor circuit that maintains symmetric bilateral muscle contraction amplitude.},

abstract = {Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings followed by histochemical staining and single-cell RT-PCR were obtained from 180 Martinotti interneurones located in layers II to VI of the somatosensory cortex of Wistar rats (P13-P16) in order to examine their anatomical, electrophysiological and molecular properties. Martinotti cells (MCs) mostly displayed ovoid-shaped somata, bitufted dendritic morphologies, and axons with characteristic spiny boutons projecting to layer I and spreading horizontally across neighbouring columns more than 1 mm. Electron microscopic examination of MC boutons revealed that all synapses were symmetrical and most synapses (71{\%}) were formed onto dendritic shafts. MCs were found to contact tuft, apical and basal dendrites in multiple neocortical layers: layer II/III MCs targeted mostly layer I and to a lesser degree layer II/III; layer IV MCs targeted mostly layer IV and to a lesser degree layer I; layer V and VI MCs targeted mostly layer IV and layer I and to a lesser degree the layer in which their somata was located. MCs typically displayed spike train accommodation (90{\%}; n = 127) in response to depolarizing somatic current injections, but some displayed non-accommodating (8{\%}) and a few displayed irregular spiking responses (2{\%}). Some accommodating and irregular spiking MCs also responded initially with bursts (17{\%}). Accommodating responses were found in all layers, non-accommodating mostly in upper layers and bursting mostly in layer V. Single-cell multiplex RT-PCR performed on 63 MCs located throughout layers II-VI, revealed that all MCs were somatostatin (SOM) positive, and negative for parvalbumin (PV) as well as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and cholecystokinin (CCK) were co- expressed with SOM in some MCs. Some layer-specific trends seem to exist. Finally, 24 accommodating MCs were examined for the expression of 26 ion channel genes. The ion channels with the highest expression in these MCs were (from highest to lowest); Cabeta1, Kv3.3, HCN4, Cabeta4, Kv3.2, Kv3.1, Kv2.1, HCN3, Caalpha1G, Kv3.4, Kv4.2, Kv1.1 and HCN2. In summary, this study provides the first detailed analysis of the anatomical, electrophysiological and molecular properties of Martinotti cells located in different neocortical layers. It is proposed that MCs are crucial interneurones for feedback inhibition in and between neocortical layers and columns.},

Here we review current knowledge specifically on layer 5 (L5) inhibitory microcircuits, which play a critical role in controlling cortical output. We focus on recent work from the well-studied rodent barrel cortex, but also draw on evidence from studies in primary visual cortex and other cortical areas. The diversity of both deep inhibitory neurons and their pyramidal cell targets make this a challenging but essential area of study in cortical computation and sensory processing.},

All current models of the molecular circadian clockwork in eukaryotic cells are based on transcription-translation feedback loops. Non-transcriptional mechanisms in the clockwork have been difficult to study in mammalian systems. We circumvented these problems by developing novel assays using human red blood cells, which have no nucleus (or DNA) and therefore cannot perform transcription. Our results show that transcription is not required for circadian oscillations in humans, and that non-transcriptional events seem to be sufficient to sustain cellular circadian rhythms. Using red blood cells, we found that peroxiredoxins, highly conserved antioxidant proteins, undergo ∼24-hour redox cycles, which persist for many days under constant conditions (that is, in the absence of external cues). Moreover, these rhythms are entrainable (that is, tunable by environmental stimuli) and temperature-compensated, both key features of circadian rhythms. We anticipate that our findings will facilitate more sophisticated cellular clock models, highlighting the interdependency of transcriptional and non-transcriptional oscillations in potentially all eukaryotic cells.},

abstract = {Local synthesis of $\beta$-actin is required for attractive turning responses to guidance cues of growth cones in vitro but its functional role in axon guidance in vivo is poorly understood. The transport and translation of $\beta$-actin mRNA is regulated by the RNA-binding protein, Vg1RBP (zipcode-binding protein-1). To examine whether Vg1RBP plays a role in axon navigation in vivo, we disrupted Vg1RBP function in embryonic Xenopus laevis retinal ganglion cells by expressing a dominant-negative Vg1RBP and by antisense morpholino knockdown. We found that attractive turning to a netrin-1 gradient in vitro was abolished in Vg1RBP-deficient axons but, surprisingly, the long-range navigation from the retina to the optic tectum was unaffected. Within the tectum, however, the branching and complexity of axon terminals were significantly reduced. High-resolution time-lapse imaging of axon terminals in vivo revealed that Vg1RBP-GFP-positive granules accumulate locally in the axon shaft immediately preceding the emergence a filopodial-like protrusion. Comparative analysis of branch dynamics showed that Vg1RBP-deficient axons extend far fewer filopodial-like protrusions than control axons and indicate that Vg1RBP promotes filopodial formation, an essential step in branch initiation. Our findings show that Vg1RBP is required for terminal arborization but not long-range axon navigation and suggest that Vg1RBP-regulated mRNA translation promotes synaptic complexity.},

abstract = {Many laboratories have begun to develop brain-computer interface (BCI) systems that provide communication and control capabilities to people with severe motor disabilities. Further progress and realization of practical applications depends on systematic evaluations and comparisons of different brain signals, recording methods, processing algorithms, output formats, and operating protocols. However, the typical BCI system is designed specifically for one particular BCI method and is, therefore, not suited to the systematic studies that are essential for continued progress. In response to this problem, we have developed a documented general-purpose BCI research and development platform called BCI2000. BCI2000 can incorporate alone or in combination any brain signals, signal processing methods, output devices, and operating protocols. This report is intended to describe to investigators, biomedical engineers, and computer scientists the concepts that the BC12000 system is based upon and gives examples of successful BCI implementations using this system. To date, we have used BCI2000 to create BCI systems for a variety of brain signals, processing methods, and applications. The data show that these systems function well in online operation and that BCI2000 satisfies the stringent real-time requirements of BCI systems. By substantially reducing labor and cost, BCI2000 facilitates the implementation of different BCI systems and other psychophysiological experiments. It is available with full documentation and free of charge for research or educational purposes and is currently being used in a variety of studies by many research groups.},

We show that loss of retrograde bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) leads to a significant reduction in levels of Rac GEF Trio and a diminution of transcription at the trio locus. We further find that Trio is required in motor neurons for normal structural growth. Finally, we show that transgenic expression of Trio in motor neurons can partially restore NMJ defects in larvae mutant for BMP signaling. Based on our findings, we propose a model in which a retrograde BMP signal from the muscle modulates GTPase activity through transcriptional regulation of Rac GEF trio, thereby regulating the homeostasis of synaptic growth at the NMJ. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The diabetes syndromes produced by the two single gene mutations, obese (ob), and diabetes (db) are identical when both genes are expressed on the same inbred background, whereas on different backgrounds the syndrome changes from a severeobesity, moderate-diabetes to a severe life-shortening diabetes. The same initial sequence of events occurs in both conditions. Increased secretion of insulin and hyperphagia is followed by moderate hyperglycaemia with a further compensatory increase in insulin secretion followed by an expansion of the beta-cell mass. On the BL/6 inbred background, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the beta cells continues until hyperglycaemia is controlled, whereas on the BL/Ks background, beta cell expansion fails and islet atrophy occurs causing insulinopenia, marked hyperglycaemia, and severe diabetes. The data presented here suggest that hyperphagia, hyperinsulinaemia, or both, early in development trigger the abnormal sequence of metabolic events leading to the obesity-diabetes state. These primary events interact with unknown genetic modifiers to produce either a juvenile or maturity-onset type of diabetes. An understanding of the mode of action of these background modifiers influencing the severity of diabetes in mice should lead to a better understanding of the ways in which unknown genetic and environmental factors contribute to human diabetes.},

abstract = {In the mouse, each class of olfactory receptor neurons expressing a given odorant receptor has convergent axonal projections to two specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, thereby creating an odour map. However, it is unclear how this map is represented in the olfactory cortex. Here we combine rabies-virus-dependent retrograde mono-trans-synaptic labelling with genetics to control the location, number and type of {\&}apos;starter{\&}apos; cortical neurons, from which we trace their presynaptic neurons. We find that individual cortical neurons receive input from multiple mitral cells representing broadly distributed glomeruli. Different cortical areas represent the olfactory bulb input differently. For example, the cortical amygdala preferentially receives dorsal olfactory bulb input, whereas the piriform cortex samples the whole olfactory bulb without obvious bias. These differences probably reflect different functions of these cortical areas in mediating innate odour preference or associative memory. The trans-synaptic labelling method described here should be widely applicable to mapping connections throughout the mouse nervous system.},

abstract = {Receptor-mediated Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is often followed by Ca2+ entry through Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels in the plasma membrane [1-5]. RNAi screens have identified STIM1 as the putative ER Ca2+ sensor [6-8] and CRACM1 (Orai1; [9-11]) as the putative store-operated Ca2+ channel. Overexpression of both proteins is required to reconstitute CRAC currents (ICRAC; [11-14]). We show here that CRACM1 forms multimeric assemblies that bind STIM1 and that acidic residues in the transmembrane (TM) and extracellular domains of CRACM1 contribute to the ionic selectivity of the CRAC-channel pore. Replacement of the conserved glutamate in position 106 of the first TM domain of CRACM1 with glutamine (E106Q) acts as a dominant-negative protein, and substitution with aspartate (E106D) enhances Na+, Ba2+, and Sr2+ permeation relative to Ca2+. Mutating E190Q in TM3 also affects channel selectivity, suggesting that glutamate residues in both TM1 and TM3 face the lumen of the pore. Furthermore, mutating a putative Ca2+ binding site in the first extracellular loop of CRACM1 (D110/112A) enhances monovalent cation permeation, suggesting that these residues too contribute to the coordination of Ca2+ ions to the pore. Our data provide unequivocal evidence that CRACM1 multimers form the Ca2+-selective CRAC-channel pore. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The spinothalamic tract (STT) has been classically viewed as the major ascending pathway for pain transmission while the dorsal column (DC) was thought to be involved primarily in signaling innocuous stimuli. Recent clinical studies have shown that limited midline myelotomy, which transects fibers in the DC, offers good pain relief in patients with visceral cancer pain. Experimental studies provided evidence that a DC lesion decreases the activation of thalamic neurons by visceral stimuli and suggested that this effect is due to transection of the axons of postsynaptic dorsal column (PSDC) neurons. In our study, Fos protein expression in retrogradely labeled STT and PSDC neurons in the lumbosacral enlargement in rats was used as an anatomical marker of enhanced activation to compare the role of these neurons in cutaneous and visceral pain. The noxious stimuli used were intradermal injection of capsaicin and distention of the ureter. Retrogradely labeled PSDC neurons were found in laminae III-IV and in the vicinity of the central canal. STT neurons were located in laminae I, III-VII and X. Ureter distention evoked Fos expression in PSDC and STT neurons located in all laminae in which retrogradely labeled cells were found, with the maximum in the L2 spinal segment. The Fos-positive PSDC neurons represented a significantly higher percentage of the retrogradely labeled PSDC neurons (19.3??2.3{\%} SEM) than of the STT Fos-positive neurons (13.2??1.5{\%} SEM). Intradermal capsaicin injection also evoked Fos expression in both PSDC and STT neurons, but with no significant difference between these two, when expressed as a percentage of the retrogradely labeled cells (11.6??2.9{\%} SEM, 10.8??1.1{\%} SEM). These results show that both PSDC and STT neurons are activated by cutaneous and visceral noxious stimuli. Their particular role in transmission and modulation of painful stimuli needs to be investigated further. ?? 2003 International Association for the study of Pain. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Visualized with 2-photon excitation laser scanning microscopy, infected neurons showed bright fluorescence that was distributed homogeneously throughout the cell, including axonal and dendritic arbors. Single dendritic spines could routinely be resolved and their morphological dynamics visualized. Viral infection and imaging were achieved throughout postnatal development up to early adulthood (P 8-30), although the viral efficiency of infection decreased with age.

This model remains tremendously influential for its reliability, specificity, and relative ease of use. More recent plasticity studies have explored various other brain regions including the neocortex, which often requires more laborious whole-cell recordings of synaptically connected pairs of neurons, to ensure that the identities of recorded cells are known. In addition, with this experimental approach, the spiking activity can be controlled with millisecond precision, which is necessary for the study of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).

Here we describe trans-Tango, a technique for anterograde transsynaptic circuit tracing and manipulation. At the core of trans-Tango is a synthetic signaling pathway that is introduced into all neurons in the animal. This pathway converts receptor activation at the cell surface into reporter expression through site-specific proteolysis. Specific labeling is achieved by presenting a tethered ligand at the synapses of genetically defined neurons, thereby activating the pathway in their postsynaptic partners and providing genetic access to these neurons. We first validated trans-Tango in the Drosophila olfactory system and then implemented it in the gustatory system, where projections beyond the first-order receptor neurons are not fully characterized. We identified putative second-order neurons within the sweet circuit that include projection neurons targeting known neuromodulation centers in the brain. These experiments establish trans-Tango as a flexible platform for transsynaptic circuit analysis.

In this paper, we address these challenges within the powerful context of kernel methods by proposing the robust time series cluster kernel (TCK). The approach taken leverages the missing data handling properties of Gaussian mixture models (GMM) augmented with informative prior distributions. An ensemble learning approach is exploited to ensure robustness to parameters by combining the clustering results of many GMM to form the final kernel. We evaluate the TCK on synthetic and real data and compare to other state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that the TCK is robust to parameter choices, provides competitive results for MTS without missing data and outstanding results for missing data.},

We examine tLTD in neocortical layer 5 (L5) pyramidal pairs and find that tLTD is expressed presynaptically, implying retrograde signaling. CB1 agonists produce depression that mimics and occludes tLTD. This agonist-induced LTD requires presynaptic activity and NMDAR activation, but not postsynaptic Ca2+ influx. Further experiments demonstrate the existence of presynaptic NMDARs that underlie the presynaptic activity dependence. Finally, manipulating cannabinoid breakdown alters the temporal window for tLTD. In conclusion, tLTD requires simultaneous activation of presynaptic NMDA and CB1 receptors.

We examined the role of Dscam in neuron-target recognition of single mechanosensory neurons, which connect with different target cells through multiple axonal branches. Analysis of Dscam null neurons demonstrated an essential role of Dscam for growth and directed extension of axon branches. Expression of randomly chosen single isoforms could not rescue connectivity but did restore basic axonal extension and rudimentary branching. Moreover, two Dscam alleles were generated that each reduced the maximally possible Dscam diversity to 22,176 isoforms. Reduction of Dscam diversity resulted in specific connectivity defects of mechanosensory neurons. Furthermore, the observed allele-specific phenotypes suggest functional differences among isoforms. Our findings provide evidence that a very large number of structurally unique receptor isoforms is required to ensure fidelity and precision of neuronal connectivity. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Mathematical models can aid in the understanding of the risks associated with the global spread of infectious diseases. To assess the current state of mathematical models for the global spread of infectious diseases, we reviewed the literature highlighting common approaches and good practice, and identifying research gaps. We followed a scoping study method and extracted information from 78 records on: modelling approaches; input data (epidemiological, population, and travel) for model parameterization; model validation data. We found that most epidemiological data come from published journal articles, population data come from a wide range of sources, and travel data mainly come from statistics or surveys, or commercial datasets. The use of commercial datasets may benefit the modeller, however makes critical appraisal of their model by other researchers more difficult. We found a minority of records (26) validated their model. We posit that this may be a result of pandemics, or far-reaching epidemics, being relatively rare events compared with other modelled physical phenomena (e.g. climate change). The sparsity of such events, and changes in outbreak recording, may make identifying suitable validation data difficult. We appreciate the challenge of modelling emerging infections given the lack of data for both model parameterisation and validation, and inherent complexity of the approaches used. However, we believe that open access datasets should be used wherever possible to aid model reproducibility and transparency. Further, modellers should validate their models where possible, or explicitly state why validation was not possible.},

In Brief Cui et al. identify a new population of spinal cord deep dorsal horn ''gating'' neurons that mediates crosstalk between touch and pain pathways. Activation or ablation of these early RET+ neurons highlights critical roles in basal and pathological pain states. SUMMARY The gate control theory (GCT) of pain proposes that pain-and touch-sensing neurons antagonize each other through spinal cord dorsal horn (DH) gating neurons. However, the exact neural circuits underly-ing the GCT remain largely elusive. Here, we identi-fied a new population of deep layer DH (dDH) inhibi-tory interneurons that express the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret neonatally. These early RET+ dDH neu-rons receive excitatory as well as polysynaptic inhib-itory inputs from touch-and/or pain-sensing affer-ents. In addition, they negatively regulate DH pain and touch pathways through both pre-and postsyn-aptic inhibition. Finally, specific ablation of early RET+ dDH neurons increases basal and chronic pain, whereas their acute activation reduces basal pain perception and relieves inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Taken together, our findings un-cover a novel spinal circuit that mediates crosstalk between touch and pain pathways and suggest that some early RET+ dDH neurons could function as pain ''gating'' neurons.},

abstract = {The sense of taste provides animals with valuable information about the nature and quality of food. Bitter taste detection functions as an important sensory input to warn against the ingestion of toxic and noxious substances. T2Rs are a family of approximately 30 highly divergent G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are selectively expressed in the tongue and palate epithelium and are implicated in bitter taste sensing. Here we demonstrate, using a combination of genetic, behavioural and physiological studies, that T2R receptors are necessary and sufficient for the detection and perception of bitter compounds, and show that differences in T2Rs between species (human and mouse) can determine the selectivity of bitter taste responses. In addition, we show that mice engineered to express a bitter taste receptor in 'sweet cells' become strongly attracted to its cognate bitter tastants, whereas expression of the same receptor (or even a novel GPCR) in T2R-expressing cells resulted in mice that are averse to the respective compounds. Together these results illustrate the fundamental principle of bitter taste coding at the periphery: dedicated cells act as broadly tuned bitter sensors that are wired to mediate behavioural aversion.},

In this report, we describe the cellular, spatial, and temporal expression patterns of dsx gene products in the developing and adult CNS by applying RT-PCR and immunohistochemical procedures, dsx gene products were detected in the CNS of 3rd-instar larvae, pupae, and adults. DSX-immunoreactive signals were observed within the brain and in both the thoracic plus abdominal ganglia of the ventral nerve cord. Most, but not all, cells inferred to contain DSX proteins (by the results of genetic controls for antibody specificity) were further determined to be neurons (by coexpression of a protein that marks such CNS cell types). Temporally varying expression of DSX was most prominently observed in the rapidly metamorphosing early and midpupal stages, suggesting that this gene contributes to establishment of sexually dimorphic neuronal structures which subserve adult sexual behaviors. Elements of the spatial and temporal patterns of DSX immunoreactivity also imply that sexually dimorphic dsx expression in certain neuronal clusters within the adult CNS could participate in ongoing operations of the mature nervous system with respect to the courtship behaviors that are affected by dsx mutations.},

Identifyingwhich neurons and circuits control which behaviors has been a laborious piecemeal process, usually for one observer-defined behavior at a time. We present a fundamentally different approach to neuron-behavior mapping. We optogenetically activated 1054 identified neuron lines in Drosophila larvae and tracked the behavioral responses from 37,780 animals. Application of multiscale unsupervised structure learning methods to the behavioral data enabled us to identify 29 discrete, statistically distinguishable, observer-unbiased behavioral phenotypes. Mapping the neural lines to the behavior(s) they evoke provides a behavioral reference atlas for neuron subsets covering a large fraction of larval neurons. This atlas is a starting point for connectivity- and activity-mapping studies to further investigate the mechanisms by which neurons mediate diverse behaviors.},

abstract = {In cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons, persistent potentiation and depression of glutamatergic synapses were induced by correlated spiking of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The relative timing between the presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking determined the direction and the extent of synaptic changes. Repetitive postsynaptic spiking within a time window of 20 msec after presynaptic activation resulted in long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas postsynaptic spiking within a window of 20 msec before the repetitive presynaptic activation led to long-term depression (LTD). Significant LTP occurred only at synapses with relatively low initial strength, whereas the extent of LTD did not show obvious dependence on the initial synaptic strength. Both LTP and LTD depended on the activation of NMDA receptors and were absent in cases in which the postsynaptic neurons were GABAergic in nature. Blockade of L-type calcium channels with nimodipine abolished the induction of LTD and reduced the extent of LTP. These results underscore the importance of precise spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type in the activity-induced modification of central synapses and suggest that Hebb's rule may need to incorporate a quantitative consideration of spike timing that reflects the narrow and asymmetric window for the induction of synaptic modification.},

abstract = {The nature of cerebral cortical circuitry has been increasingly clarified by markers for the identification of precise cell types with specific morphology, connectivity and distinct physiological properties. Molecular markers are not only helpful in dissecting cortical circuitry, but also give insight into the mechanisms of cortical neuronal specification and differentiation. The two principal neuronal types of the cerebral cortex are the pyramidal and GABAergic cells. Pyramidal cells are excitatory and project to distant targets, while GABAergic neurons are mostly inhibitory non-pyramidal interneurons. Reliable markers for specific subtypes of interneurons are available and have been employed in the classification and functional analysis of cortical circuitry. Until recently, cortical pyramidal neurons have been considered a homogeneous class of cells. This concept is now changing as the powerful tools of molecular biology and genetics identify molecular tags for subtypes of pyramidal cells such as: Otx-1 [Frantz, G.D., Bohner, A.P., Akers, R.M., McConnell, S.K., 1994.

They also indicate specific developmental programs operate in cell fate decisions. This review will describe the progress made on the correlation of these markers to each other within a specific subtype of layer V neurons with identified, stereotypic projections. Further work is needed to link these data with observations on somatodendritic morphology and physiological properties.

abstract = {We show that a natural behavior, exploration of a novel environment, causes DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in neurons of young adult wild-type mice. DSBs occurred in multiple brain regions, were most abundant in the dentate gyrus, which is involved in learning and memory, and were repaired within 24 h. Increasing neuronal activity by sensory or optogenetic stimulation increased neuronal DSBs in relevant but not irrelevant networks. Mice transgenic for human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP), which simulate key aspects of Alzheimer's disease, had increased neuronal DSBs at baseline and more severe and prolonged DSBs after exploration. Interventions that suppress aberrant neuronal activity and improve learning and memory in hAPP mice normalized their levels of DSBs. Blocking extrasynaptic NMDA-type glutamate receptors prevented amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$)-induced DSBs in neuronal cultures. Thus, transient increases in neuronal DSBs occur as a result of physiological brain activity, and A$\beta$ exacerbates DNA damage, most likely by eliciting synaptic dysfunction.},

We fabricated and implanted the four-shank probes, each integrated with 12 ??LEDs and 32 recording sites, into the CA1 pyramidal layer of anesthetized and freely moving mice. Spikes were robustly induced by 60 nW light power, and fast population oscillations were induced at the microwatt range. To demonstrate the spatiotemporal precision of parallel stimulation and recording, we achieved independent control of distinct cells {\~{}}50 ??m apart and of differential somato-dendritic compartments of single neurons. The scalability and spatiotemporal resolution of this monolithic optogenetic tool provides versatility and precision for cellular-level circuit analysis in deep structures of intact, freely moving animals.},

abstract = {Negative selection against deleterious alleles produced by mutation is the most common form of natural selection, which strongly influences within-population variation and interspecific divergence. However, some fundamental properties of negative selection remain obscure. In particular, it is still not known whether deleterious alleles affect fitness independently, so that cumulative fitness loss depends exponentially on the number of deleterious alleles, or synergistically, so that each additional deleterious allele results in a larger decrease in relative fitness. Negative selection with synergistic epistasis must produce negative linkage disequilibrium between deleterious alleles, and therefore, underdispersed distribution of the number of deleterious alleles in the genome. Indeed, we detected underdispersion of the number of rare loss-of-function (LoF) alleles in eight independent datasets from modern human and Drosophila melanogaster populations. Thus, ongoing selection against deleterious alleles is characterized by synergistic epistasis, which can explain how human and fly populations persist despite very high genomic deleterious mutation rates.},

abstract = {Recent studies have indicated that exogenously administered neurotrophins produce antidepressant-like behavioral effects. We have here investigated the role of endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor trkB in the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. We found that trkB.T1-overexpressing transgenic mice, which show reduced trkB activation in brain, as well as heterozygous BDNF null (BDNF(+/)-) mice, were resistant to the effects of antidepressants in the forced swim test, indicating that normal trkB signaling is required for the behavioral effects typically produced by antidepressants. In contrast, neurotrophin-3(+/)- mice showed a normal behavioral response to antidepressants. Furthermore, acute as well as chronic antidepressant treatment induced autophosphorylation and activation of trkB in cerebral cortex, particularly in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus. Tyrosines in the trkB autophosphorylation site were phosphorylated in response to antidepressants, but phosphorylation of the shc binding site was not observed. Nevertheless, phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein was increased by antidepressants in the prefrontal cortex concomitantly with trkB phosphorylation and this response was reduced in trkB.T1-overexpressing mice. Our data suggest that antidepressants acutely increase trkB signaling in a BDNF-dependent manner in cerebral cortex and that this signaling is required for the behavioral effects typical of antidepressant drugs. Neurotrophin signaling increased by antidepressants may induce formation and stabilization of synaptic connectivity, which gradually leads to the clinical antidepressive effects and mood recovery.},

Here, we used intersectional genetic manipulations to identify these critical components of pain transduction. Marking and ablating six populations of spinal excitatory and inhibitory neurons, coupled with behavioral and electrophysiological analysis, showed that excitatory neurons expressing somatostatin (SOM) include T-type cells, whose ablation causes loss of mechanical pain. Inhibitory neurons marked by the expression of dynorphin (Dyn) represent INs, which are necessary to gate A?? fibers from activating SOM+ neurons to evoke pain. Therefore, peripheral mechanical nociceptors and A?? mechanoreceptors, together with spinal SOM+ excitatory and Dyn+ inhibitory neurons, form a microcircuit that transmits and gates mechanical pain.

abstract = {Motor systems can be functionally organized into effector organs (muscles and glands), the motor neurons, central pattern generators (CPG) and higher control centers of the brain. Using genetic and electrophysiological methods, we have begun to deconstruct the motor system driving Drosophila larval feeding behavior into its component parts. In this paper, we identify distinct clusters of motor neurons that execute head tilting, mouth hook movements, and pharyngeal pumping during larval feeding. This basic anatomical scaffold enabled the use of calcium-imaging to monitor the neural activity of motor neurons within the central nervous system (CNS) that drive food intake. Simultaneous nerve- and muscle-recordings demonstrate that the motor neurons innervate the cibarial dilator musculature (CDM) ipsi- and contra-laterally. By classical lesion experiments we localize a set of CPGs generating the neuronal pattern underlying feeding movements to the subesophageal zone (SEZ). Lesioning of higher brain centers decelerated all feeding-related motor patterns, whereas lesioning of ventral nerve cord (VNC) only affected the motor rhythm underlying pharyngeal pumping. These findings provide a basis for progressing upstream of the motor neurons to identify higher regulatory components of the feeding motor system.},

The potential for this behavior is specified by the male-specific products of the fruitless (fru M) gene; males without fruM do not court females when held in isolation. We show that such fruM null males acquire the potential for courtship when grouped with other flies; they apparently learn to court flies with which they were grouped, irrespective of sex or species and retain this behavior for at least a week. The male-specific product of the doublesex gene (dsxM) is necessary and sufficient for the acquisition of the potential for such experience-dependent courtship. These results reveal a process that builds, via dsxM and social experience, the potential for a more flexible sexual behavior, which could be evolutionarily conserved as dsx-related genes that function in sexual development are found throughout the animal kingdom. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Increases in the intracellular concentration of calcium ([Ca2+]i) activate various signaling pathways that lead to the expression of genes that are essential for dendritic development, neuronal survival, and synaptic plasticity. The mode of Ca2+ entry into a neuron plays a key role in determining which signaling pathways are activated and thus specifies the cellular response to Ca2+. Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-activated channels (LTCs) is particularly effective at activating transcription factors such as CREB and MEF-2. We developed a functional knock-in technique to investigate the features of LTCs that specifically couple them to the signaling pathways that regulate gene expression. We found that an isoleucine-glutamine ("IQ") motif in the carboxyl terminus of the LTC that binds Ca2+-calmodulin (CaM) is critical for conveying the Ca2+ signal to the nucleus. Ca2+-CaM binding to the LTC was necessary for activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which conveys local Ca2+ signals from the mouth of the LTC to the nucleus. CaM functions as a local Ca2+ sensor at the mouth of the LTC that activates the MAPK pathway and leads to the stimulation of genes that are essential for neuronal survival and plasticity},

abstract = {Background: After mating, Drosophila females undergo a remarkable phenotypic switch resulting in decreased sexual receptivity and increased egg laying. Transfer of male sex peptide (SP) during copulation mediates these postmating responses via sensory neurons that coexpress the sex-determination gene fruitless (fru) and the proprioceptive neuronal marker pickpocket (ppk) in the female reproductive system. Little is known about the neuronal pathways involved in relaying SP-sensory information to central circuits and how these inputs are processed to direct female-specific changes that occur in response to mating. Results: We demonstrate an essential role played by neurons expressing the sex-determination gene doublesex (dsx) in regulating the female postmating response. We uncovered shared circuitry between dsx and a subset of the previously described SP-responsive fru+/ppk+-expressing neurons in the reproductive system. In addition, we identified sexually dimorphic dsx circuitry within the abdominal ganglion (Abg) critical for mediating postmating responses. Some of these dsx neurons target posterior regions of the brain while others project onto the uterus. Conclusions: We propose that dsx-specified circuitry is required to induce female postmating behavioral responses, from sensing SP to conveying this signal to higher-order circuits for processing and through to the generation of postmating behavioral and physiological outputs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This widespread adoption has been largely fueled by the emergence of the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology, an important new approach for generating RNA-guided nucleases, such as Cas9, with customizable specificities. Genome editing mediated by these nucleases has been used to rapidly, easily and efficiently modify endogenous genes in a wide variety of biomedically important cell types and in organisms that have traditionally been challenging to manipulate genetically. Furthermore, a modified version of the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been developed to recruit heterologous domains that can regulate endogenous gene expression or label specific genomic loci in living cells. Although the genome-wide specificities of CRISPR-Cas9 systems remain to be fully defined, the power of these systems to perform targeted, highly efficient alterations of genome sequence and gene expression will undoubtedly transform biological research and spur the development of novel molecular therapeutics for human disease.},

Here, using genetic and radiological methods, we show that disrupting antidepressant-induced neurogenesis blocks behavioral responses to antidepressants. Serotonin 1A receptor null mice were insensitive to the neurogenic and behavioral effects of fluoxetine, a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor. X-irradiation of a restricted region of mouse brain containing the hippocampus prevented the neurogenic and behavioral effects of two classes of antidepressants. These findings suggest that the behavioral effects of chronic antidepressants may be mediated by the stimulation of neurogenesis in the hippocampus. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {In recent years, the Cre integrase from bacteriophage P1 has become an essential tool for conditional gene activation and/or inactivation in mouse. In an earlier report, we described a fusion protein between Cre and a mutated form of the ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor (Cre-ERTM) that renders Cre activity tamoxifen (TM) inducible, allowing for conditional modification of gene activity in the mammalian neural tube in utero. In the current work, we have generated a transgenic mouse line in which Cre-ERTM is ubiquitously expressed to permit temporally regulated Cre-mediated recombination in diverse tissues of the mouse at embryonic and adult stages. We demonstrate that a single, intraperitoneal injection of TM into a pregnant mouse at 8.5 days postcoitum leads to detectable recombination in the developing embryo within 6 h of injection and efficient recombination of a reporter gene in derivatives of all three germ layers within 24 h of injection. In addition, by varying the dose of TM injected, the percentage of cells undergoing a recombination event in the embryo can be controlled. Dose-dependent excision induced by TM was also possible in diverse tissues in the adult mouse, including the central nervous system, and in cultured cells derived from the transgenic mouse line. This inducible Cre system will be a broadly useful tool to modulate gene activity in mouse embryos, adults, and culture systems where temporal control is an important consideration.},

abstract = {It is unclear where in the nervous system evolutionary changes tend to occur. To localize the source of neural evolution that has generated divergent behaviors, we developed a new approach to label and functionally manipulate homologous neurons across Drosophila species. We examined homologous descending neurons that drive courtship song in two species that sing divergent song types and localized relevant evolutionary changes in circuit function downstream of the intrinsic physiology of these descending neurons. This evolutionary change causes different species to produce divergent motor patterns in similar social contexts. Artificial stimulation of these descending neurons drives multiple song types, suggesting that multifunctional properties of song circuits may facilitate rapid evolution of song types.},

abstract = {To maintain homeostasis, hypothalamic neurons in the arcuate nucleus must dynamically sense and integrate a multitude of peripheral signals. Blood-borne molecules must therefore be able to circumvent the tightly sealed vasculature of the blood-brain barrier to rapidly access their target neurons. However, how information encoded by circulating appetite-modifying hormones is conveyed to central hypothalamic neurons remains largely unexplored. Using in vivo multiphoton microscopy together with fluorescently labeled ligands, we demonstrate that circulating ghrelin, a versatile regulator of energy expenditure and feeding behavior, rapidly binds neurons in the vicinity of fenestrated capillaries, and that the number of labeled cell bodies varies with feeding status. Thus, by virtue of its vascular connections, the hypothalamus is able to directly sense peripheral signals, modifying energy status accordingly.},

abstract = {During development, thalamocortical (TC) input has a critical role in the spatial delineation and patterning of cortical areas, yet the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive cortical neuron differentiation are poorly understood. In the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortex, layer 4 (L4) neurons receive mutually exclusive input originating from two thalamic nuclei: the ventrobasalis (VB), which conveys tactile input, and the posterior nucleus (Po), which conveys modulatory and nociceptive input. Recently, we have shown that L4 neuron identity is not fully committed postnatally, implying a capacity for TC input to influence differentiation during cortical circuit assembly. Here we investigate whether the cell-type-specific molecular and functional identity of L4 neurons is instructed by the origin of their TC input. Genetic ablation of the VB at birth resulted in an anatomical and functional rewiring of Po projections onto L4 neurons in S1. This induced acquisition of Po input led to a respecification of postsynaptic L4 neurons, which developed functional molecular features of Po-target neurons while repressing VB-target traits. Respecified L4 neurons were able to respond both to touch and to noxious stimuli, in sharp contrast to the normal segregation of these sensory modalities in distinct cortical circuits. These findings reveal a behaviourally relevant TC-input-type-specific control over the molecular and functional differentiation of postsynaptic L4 neurons and cognate intracortical circuits, which instructs the development of modality-specific neuronal and circuit properties during corticogenesis.},

abstract = {The use of genetically engineered mice has been a major development in neuroscience research. Genetic engineering is an undoubtedly powerful technique; however, the value of this approach has been debated, particularly in relation to its use to probe the underlying bases of complex behaviors, such as memory. A recent new development of the technique is the ability to target a specific gene knockout to a particular subregion or even to specific and limited cell types of the mouse brain. An example of this approach is the knockout of the NMDARI gene in only CAI-pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. The resulting animals can be tested by several methods, including in vivo multielectrode recording during behavioral tasks. The data provide strong evidence in favor of the notion that NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity at CAI synapses is required for both the acquisition of spatial memory and the formation of normal CAI place fields. This relationship suggests that robust place fields may be essential for spatial memory.},

abstract = {Two major classes of pyramidal neurons can be distinguished in layer 5 of the adult rat visual cortex. Cells of the "thick/tufted" type have stout apical dendrites with terminal tufts, and most of them project to the superior colliculus (Larkman and Mason: J Neurosci 10:407, '90; Kasper et al.: J Comp Neurol, this issue, 339:459-474). "Slender/untufted" cells have thinner apical trunks with no obvious terminal tufts, and a substantial proportion of them project to the contralateral visual cortex. These two types also differ in their intrinsic electrophysiological features. In this study we describe the postnatal maturation of the electrophysiological and synaptic properties of layer 5 pyramidal neurons and relate these findings to the morphological development and divergence of the two cell types. Living slices were prepared from the visual cortex of rats aged between postnatal day 3 (P3) and young adults and maintained in vitro. Stable intracellular impalements were obtained from a total of 63 pyramidal cells of layer 5 at various ages, which were injected with biocytin so that morphological and electrophysiological data could be obtained from the same cell. Before P15, injection of a single cell sometimes stained a cluster of neurons of similar morphology, probably as a result of dye coupling. The incidence of such clustering and the number of neurons within each cluster decreased with age. There was no obvious difference in electrophysiological properties between cells in clusters and age-matched, noncoupled neurons. From P5, the apical dendrites of neurons could easily be classified as "thick/tufted" or "slender/untufted." On average, the resting potential became more negative, and membrane time constant and input resistance decreased with age. Electrophysiological differences between the "thick/tufted" and "slender/untufted" cell types did not become apparent until the third postnatal week, after which the "thick/tufted" cells on average had lower input resistances and slightly faster time constants than "slender/untufted" cells. The current-voltage relations of the neurons became progressively more nonlinear during maturation, with both rapid inward rectification and time-dependent rectification or "sag" becoming more prominent. There were also changes in the amplitude and waveform of action potentials, which generally approached adult values by 3 weeks of age. Action potential threshold became more negative, both in absolute terms and relative to the resting membrane potential. Action potentials became larger in peak amplitude and of shorter duration, with both rise and fall times decreasing progressively during development.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Little is known about how Fru proteins function at the level of transcriptional regulation or the role that isoform diversity plays in the formation of a male-specific nervous system. Results To characterize the roles of sex-specific Fru isoforms in specifying male behavior, we generated novel isoform-specific mutants and used a genomic approach to identify direct Fru isoform targets during development. We demonstrate that all Fru isoforms directly target genes involved in the development of the nervous system, with individual isoforms exhibiting unique binding specificities. We observe that fru behavioral phenotypes are specified by either a single isoform or a combination of isoforms. Finally, we illustrate the utility of these data for the identification of novel sexually dimorphic genomic enhancers and novel downstream regulators of male sexual behavior. Conclusions These findings suggest that Fru isoform diversity facilitates both redundancy and specificity in gene expression, and that the regulation of neuronal developmental genes may be the most ancient and conserved role of fru in the specification of a male-specific nervous system. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Mating elicits profound behavioral and physiological changes in many species that are crucial for reproductive success. After copulation, Drosophila melanogaster females reduce their sexual receptivity and increase egg laying [1, 2]. Transfer of male sex peptide (SP) during copulation mediates these postmating responses [1, 3-6] via SP sensory neurons in the uterus defined by coexpression of the proprioceptive neuronal marker pickpocket (ppk) and the sex-determination genes doublesex (dsx) and fruitless (fru) [7-9]. Although neurons expressing dsx downstream of SP signaling have been shown to regulate postmating behaviors [9], how the female nervous system coordinates the change from pre- to postcopulatory states is unknown. Here, we show a role of the neuromodulator octopamine (OA) in the female postmating response. Lack of OA disrupts postmating responses in mated females, while increase of OA induces postmating responses in virgin females. Using a novel dsxFLP allele, we uncovered dsx neuronal elements associated with OA signaling involved in modulation of postmating responses. We identified a small subset of sexually dimorphic OA/dsx+ neurons (approximately nine cells in females) in the abdominal ganglion. Our results are consistent with a model whereby OA neuronal signaling increases after copulation, which in turn modulates changes in female behavior and physiology in response to reproductive state. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The involvement of dopamine (DA) in drug reinforcement is well established, but much less in known about its contribution to addiction. We have used positron emission tomography to investigate in humans the role of DA in drug reinforcement, addiction and drug vulnerability. We have shown that during drug intoxication increases in striatal DA are associated with the drug's reinforcing effects only if the DA changes occur rapidly. These results corroborate the relevance of drug-induced DA increases and of pharmacokinetics in the rewarding effects of drugs in humans. During withdrawal, we have shown significant reductions in DA D(2) receptors and in DA release in drug abusers, which is likely to result in decreased sensitivity to non-drug-related reinforcing stimuli. The DA D(2) reductions were associated with decreased activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, which we postulate is one of the mechanisms underlying compulsive drug administration in the addict. In fact, during craving the orbitofrontal cortex becomes hyperactive in proportion to the desire for the drug. In non-drug-abusing subjects striatal DA D(2) receptors levels predicted the reinforcing responses to stimulant drugs, providing evidence that striatal DA D(2) receptors modulate reinforcing responses to stimulants in humans and may contribute to the predisposition for drug self-administration.},

abstract = {The evolution of behavior seems inconsistent with the deep homology of neuromodulatory signaling. G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) evolved slowly from a common ancestor through a process involving gene duplication, neofunctionalization, and loss. Neuropeptides co-evolved with their receptors and exhibit many conserved functions. Furthermore, brain areas are highly conserved with suggestions of deep anatomical homology between arthropods and vertebrates. Yet, behavior evolved more rapidly; even members of the same genus or species can differ in heritable behavior. The solution to the paradox involves changes in the compartmentalization, or subfunctionalization, of neuromodulation; neurons shift their expression of GPCRs and the content of monoamines and neuropeptides. Furthermore, parallel evolution of neuromodulatory signaling systems suggests a route for repeated evolution of similar behaviors. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {SYNOPSIS Larval Drosophila move up attractive chemical gradients, and down aversive ones. Although their movement is often characterised as a series of runs and directed turns, it can also be modelled as a continuous modulation of turning extent by the detected change in stimulus intensity as the animal moves through the gradient. We show that a neuromechanical model of peristaltic crawling and spontaneous bending in the larva can be adapted to produce taxis behaviour by the simple addition of a local segmental reflex to modulate transverse viscosity (or 'bendiness') proportionally to the intensity change detected in the head. Altering the gain produces weaker or stronger, negative or positive taxis, with behavioural statistics that qualitatively match the larva.},

We then review recent progress in our understanding of the development of the circuits as well as studies that apply optogenetics and other innovative techniques to dissect the circuit diagram. New approaches using Drosophila as a model system are now making it possible to search for developmental rules that regulate the construction of neural circuits.},

abstract = {Natural events present multiple types of sensory cues, each detected by a specialized sensory modality. Combining information from several modalities is essential for the selection of appropriate actions. Key to understanding multimodal computations is determining the structural patterns of multimodal convergence and how these patterns contribute to behaviour. Modalities could converge early, late or at multiple levels in the sensory processing hierarchy. Here we show that combining mechanosensory and nociceptive cues synergistically enhances the selection of the fastest mode of escape locomotion in Drosophila larvae. In an electron microscopy volume that spans the entire insect nervous system, we reconstructed the multisensory circuit supporting the synergy, spanning multiple levels of the sensory processing hierarchy. The wiring diagram revealed a complex multilevel multimodal convergence architecture. Using behavioural and physiological studies, we identified functionally connected circuit nodes that trigger the fastest locomotor mode, and others that facilitate it, and we provide evidence that multiple levels of multimodal integration contribute to escape mode selection. We propose that the multilevel multimodal convergence architecture may be a general feature of multisensory circuits enabling complex input-output functions and selective tuning to ecologically relevant combinations of cues.},

Perceptual learning optimizes the representations of important sensory stimuli. Associative learning and the initial phase of motor skill learning are ensured by feedback-based mechanisms that permit trial-and-error learning. The later phase of motor skill learning may primarily involve feedback-independent mechanisms operating under the classic Hebbian rule.

abstract = {The dendrites of neurons in the mammalian central nervous system have been considered as electrically passive structures which funnel synaptic potentials to the soma and axon initial segment, the site of action potential initiation. More recent studies, however, have shown that the dendrites of many neurons are not passive, but contain active conductances. The role of these dendritic voltage-activated channels in the initiation of action potentials in neurons is largely unknown. To assess this directly, patch-clamp recordings were made from the dendrites of neocortical pyramidal cells in brain slices. Voltage-activated sodium currents were observed in dendritic outside-out patches, while action potentials could be evoked by depolarizing current pulses or by synaptic stimulation during dendritic whole-cell recordings. To determine the site of initiation of these action potentials, simultaneous whole-cell recordings were made from the soma and the apical dendrite or axon of the same cell. These experiments showed that action potentials are initiated first in the axon and then actively propagate back into the dendritic tree.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

Here, we demonstrate a previously unknown interaction between two components of the presynaptic active zone, RIM1 and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs), that controls neurotransmitter release in mammalian neurons. RIM1 associated with VDCC beta-subunits via its C terminus to markedly suppress voltage-dependent inactivation among different neuronal VDCCs. Consistently, in pheochromocytoma neuroendocrine PC12 cells, acetylcholine release was significantly potentiated by the full-length and C-terminal RIM1 constructs, but membrane docking of vesicles was enhanced only by the full-length RIM1. The beta construct beta-AID dominant negative, which disrupts the RIM1-beta association, accelerated the inactivation of native VDCC currents, suppressed vesicle docking and acetylcholine release in PC12 cells, and inhibited glutamate release in cultured cerebellar neurons. Thus, RIM1 association with beta in the presynaptic active zone supports release via two distinct mechanisms: sustaining Ca2+ influx through inhibition of channel inactivation, and anchoring neurotransmitter-containing vesicles in the vicinity of VDCCs.},

abstract = {Food intake is regulated by the hypothalamus, including the melanocortin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) systems in the arcuate nucleus. The NPY Y2 receptor (Y2R), a putative inhibitory presynaptic receptor, is highly expressed on NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus, which is accessible to peripheral hormones. Peptide YY(3-36) (PYY(3-36)), a Y2R agonist, is released from the gastrointestinal tract postprandially in proportion to the calorie content of a meal. Here we show that peripheral injection of PYY(3-36) in rats inhibits food intake and reduces weight gain. PYY(3-36) also inhibits food intake in mice but not in Y2r-null mice, which suggests that the anorectic effect requires the Y2R. Peripheral administration of PYY(3-36) increases c-Fos immunoreactivity in the arcuate nucleus and decreases hypothalamic Npy messenger RNA. Intra-arcuate injection of PYY(3-36) inhibits food intake. PYY(3-36) also inhibits electrical activity of NPY nerve terminals, thus activating adjacent pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. In humans, infusion of normal postprandial concentrations of PYY(3-36) significantly decreases appetite and reduces food intake by 33{\%} over 24 h. Thus, postprandial elevation of PYY(3-36) may act through the arcuate nucleus Y2R to inhibit feeding in a gut-hypothalamic pathway.},

abstract = {Ion channelopathies are inherited diseases in which alterations in control of ion conductance through the central pore of ion channels impair cell function, leading to periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmia, renal failure, epilepsy, migraine and ataxia. Here we show that, in contrast with this well-established paradigm, three mutations in gating-charge-carrying arginine residues in an S4 segment that cause hypokalaemic periodic paralysis induce a hyperpolarization-activated cationic leak through the voltage sensor of the skeletal muscle Na(V)1.4 channel. This 'gating pore current' is active at the resting membrane potential and closed by depolarizations that activate the voltage sensor. It has similar permeability to Na+, K+ and Cs+, but the organic monovalent cations tetraethylammonium and N-methyl-D-glucamine are much less permeant. The inorganic divalent cations Ba2+, Ca2+ and Zn2+ are not detectably permeant and block the gating pore at millimolar concentrations. Our results reveal gating pore current in naturally occurring disease mutations of an ion channel and show a clear correlation between mutations that cause gating pore current and hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. This gain-of-function gating pore current would contribute in an important way to the dominantly inherited membrane depolarization, action potential failure, flaccid paralysis and cytopathology that are characteristic of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. A survey of other ion channelopathies reveals numerous examples of mutations that would be expected to cause gating pore current, raising the possibility of a broader impact of gating pore current in ion channelopathies.},

abstract = {Efforts to define the neural circuits generating locomotor behavior have produced an initial understanding of some of the components within the spinal cord, as well as a basic understanding of several invertebrate motor pattern generators. However, how these circuits are assembled during development is poorly understood. We are defining the neural circuit that generates larval locomotion in the genetically tractable fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to study locomotor circuit development. Forward larval locomotion involves a stereotyped posterior-to-anterior segmental translocation of body wall muscle contraction and is generated by a relatively small number of identified muscles, motor and sensory neurons, plus an unknown number of the {\~{}}. 270 bilaterally-paired interneurons per segment of the 1st instar larva. To begin identifying the relevant interneurons, we have conditionally inactivated synaptic transmission of interneuron subsets and assayed for the effects on locomotion. From this screen we have identified a subset of 25 interneurons per hemisegment, called the lateral locomotor neurons (LLNs), that are required for locomotion. Both inactivation and constitutive activation of the LLNs disrupt locomotion, indicating that patterned output of the LLNs is required. By expressing a calcium indicator in the LLNs, we found that they display a posterior-to-anterior wave of activity within the CNS corresponding to the segmental translocation of the muscle contraction wave. Identification of the LLNs represents the first step toward elucidating the circuit generating larval locomotion.},

abstract = {Excessive activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors increases oxidative stress, contributing to the neuronal death observed following neurological insults such as ischemia and seizures. Post-translational histone modifications may be key mediators in the detection and repair of damage resulting from oxidative stress, including DNA damage, and may thus affect neuronal survival in the aftermath of insults characterized by excessive glutamate release. In non-neuronal cells, phosphorylation of histone variant H2A.X (termed gamma-H2AX) occurs rapidly following DNA double-strand breaks. We investigated gamma-H2AX formation in rat cortical neurons (days in vitro 14) following activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate glutamate receptors using fluorescent immunohistochemical techniques. Moreover, we evaluated the co-localization of gamma-H2AX 'foci' with Mre11, a double-strand break repair protein, to provide further evidence for the activation of this DNA damage response pathway. Here we show that minimally cytotoxic stimulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors was sufficient to evoke gamma-H2AX in neurons, and that NMDA-induced gamma-H2AX foci formation was attenuated by pretreatment with the antioxidant, Vitamin E, and the intracellular calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM. Moreover, a subset of gamma-H2AX foci co-localized with Mre11, indicating that at least a portion of gamma-H2AX foci is damage dependent. The extent of gamma-H2AX induction following glutamate receptor activation corresponded to the increases we observed following conventional DNA damaging agents [i.e. non-lethal doses of gamma-radiation (1 Gy) and hydrogen peroxide (10 microm)]. These data suggest that insults not necessarily resulting in neuronal death induce the DNA damage-evoked chromatin modification, gamma-H2AX, and implicate a role for histone alterations in determining neuronal vulnerability following neurological insults.},

abstract = {Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are extracellular matrix structures mainly enwrapping parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons. The assembly of PNNs coincides with the end of the period of heightened visual cortex plasticity in juveniles, whereas removal of PNNs in adults reopens for plasticity. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. We have used chronic electrophysiological recordings to investigate accompanying electrophysiological changes to activity-dependent plasticity and we report on novel mechanisms involved in both induced and critical period plasticity. By inducing activity-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex of adult rats while recording single unit and population activity, we demonstrate that PNN removal alters the balance between inhibitory and excitatory spiking activity directly. Without PNNs, inhibitory activity was reduced, whereas spiking variability was increased as predicted in a simulation with a Brunel neural network. Together with a shift in ocular dominance and large effects on unit activity during the first 48 h of monocular deprivation (MD), we show that PNN removal resets the neural network to an immature, juvenile state. Furthermore, in PNN-depleted adults as well as in juveniles, MD caused an immediate potentiation of gamma activity, suggesting a novel mechanism initiating activity-dependent plasticity and driving the rapid changes in unit activity.},

abstract = {The synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis of protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation asserts that the induction of synaptic potentiation creates only the potential for a lasting change in synaptic efficacy, but not the commitment to such a change. Other neural activity, before or after induction, can also determine whether persistent change occurs. Recent findings, leading us to revise the original hypothesis, indicate that the induction of a local, synapse-specific 'tagged' state and the expression of long-term potentiation are dissociable. Additional observations suggest that there are major differences in the mechanisms of functional and structural plasticity. These advances call for a revised theory that incorporates the specific molecular and structural processes involved. Addressing the physiological relevance of previous in vitro findings, new behavioural studies have experimentally translated the hypothesis to learning and the consolidation of newly formed memories.},

@article{Morimoto2004,
abstract = {This review focuses on the remodeling of brain circuitry associated with epilepsy, particularly in excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA systems, including alterations in synaptic efficacy, growth of new connections, and loss of existing connections. From recent studies on the kindling and status epilepticus models, which have been used most extensively to investigate temporal lobe epilepsy, it is now clear that the brain reorganizes itself in response to excess neural activation, such as seizure activity. The contributing factors to this reorganization include activation of glutamate receptors, second messengers, immediate early genes, transcription factors, neurotrophic factors, axon guidance molecules, protein synthesis, neurogenesis, and synaptogenesis. Some of the resulting changes may, in turn, contribute to the permanent alterations in seizure susceptibility. There is increasing evidence that neurogenesis and synaptogenesis can appear not only in the mossy fiber pathway in the hippocampus but also in other limbic structures. Neuronal loss, induced by prolonged seizure activity, may also contribute to circuit restructuring, particularly in the status epilepticus model. However, it is unlikely that any one structure, plastic system, neurotrophin, or downstream effector pathway is uniquely critical for epileptogenesis. The sensitivity of neural systems to the modulation of inhibition makes a disinhibition hypothesis compelling for both the triggering stage of the epileptic response and the long-term changes that promote the epileptic state. Loss of selective types of interneurons, alteration of GABA receptor configuration, and/or decrease in dendritic inhibition could contribute to the development of spontaneous seizures. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Antigen stimulation of immune cells triggers Ca2+ entry through Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels, promoting the immune response to pathogens by activating the transcription factor NFAT. We have previously shown that cells from patients with one form of hereditary severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) syndrome are defective in store-operated Ca2+ entry and CRAC channel function. Here we identify the genetic defect in these patients, using a combination of two unbiased genome-wide approaches: a modified linkage analysis with single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays, and a Drosophila RNA interference screen designed to identify regulators of store-operated Ca2+ entry and NFAT nuclear import. Both approaches converged on a novel protein that we call Orai1, which contains four putative transmembrane segments. The SCID patients are homozygous for a single missense mutation in ORAI1, and expression of wild-type Orai1 in SCID T cells restores store-operated Ca2+ influx and the CRAC current (I(CRAC)). We propose that Orai1 is an essential component or regulator of the CRAC channel complex.},

abstract = {Studying the laminar pattern of neural activity is crucial for understanding the processing of neural signals in the cerebral cortex. We measured neural population activity [multiunit spike activity (MUA) and local field potential, LFP] in Macaque primary visual cortex (V1) in response to drifting grating stimuli. Sustained visually driven MUA was at an approximately constant level across cortical depth in V1. However, sustained, visually driven, local field potential power, which was concentrated in the gamma-band (20-60 Hz), was greatest at the cortical depth corresponding to cortico-cortical output layers 2, 3, and 4B. gamma-band power also tends to be more sustained in the output layers. Overall, cortico-cortical output layers accounted for 67{\%} of total gamma-band activity in V1, whereas 56{\%} of total spikes evoked by drifting gratings were from layers 2, 3, and 4B. The high-resolution layer specificity of gamma-band power, the laminar distribution of MUA and gamma-band activity, and their dynamics imply that neural activity in V1 is generated by laminar-specific mechanisms. In particular, visual responses of MUA and gamma-band activity in cortico-cortical output layers 2, 3, and 4B seem to be strongly influenced by laminar-specific recurrent circuitry and/or feedback.},

Most young mice acquired the spatial task, whereas only a minority of aged mice did. Aged mice not only made significantly more errors but also exhibited greater individual differences. Slices from the hippocampus of aged mice exhibited significantly reduced L-LTP, and this was significantly and negatively correlated with errors in memory. Because L-LTP depends on cAMP activation, we examined whether drugs that enhanced cAMP would attenuate the L-LTP and memory defects. Both dopamine D1/D5 receptor agonists, which are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase, and a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor ameliorated the physiological as well as the memory defects, consistent with the idea that a cAMP-protein kinase A-dependent signaling pathway is defective in age-related spatial memory loss.},

The relative role of these factors and the form of neuronal activity responsible for circuit development is a matter of significant debate. In the mammalian visual system, retinal ganglion cell projections to the brain are mapped with respect to retinotopic location and eye of origin. We manipulated the pattern of spontaneous retinal waves present during development without changing overall activity levels through the transgenic expression of $\beta$2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in retinal ganglion cells of mice. We used this manipulation to demonstrate that spontaneous retinal activity is not just permissive, but instructive in the emergence of eye-specific segregation and retinotopic refinement in the mouse visual system. This suggests that specific patterns of spontaneous activity throughout the developing brain are essential in the emergence of specific and distinct patterns of neuronal connectivity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In most animals, it remains unknown how neural circuits switch between antagonistic behaviors: via top-down activation/inhibition of antagonistic circuits or via reciprocal inhibition between antagonistic circuits. Here, we use genetic screens, intersectional genetics, circuit reconstruction by electron microscopy, and functional optogenetics to identify a bilateral pair of Drosophila larval ‘mooncrawler descending neurons' (MDNs) with command-like ability to coordinately induce backward locomotion and block forward locomotion; the former by stimulating a backward-active premotor neuron, and the latter by disynaptic inhibition of a forward-specific premotor neuron. In contrast, direct monosynaptic reciprocal inhibition between forward and backward circuits was not observed. Thus, MDNs coordinate a transition between antagonistic larval locomotor behaviors. Interestingly, larval MDNs persist into adulthood, where they can trigger backward walking. Thus, MDNs induce backward locomotion in both limbless and limbed animals.},

Using Drosophila larvae, we found that nociceptive rolling behavior was triggered at lower temperatures and at higher frequencies when the temperature increased rapidly. We identified neurons in the brain that were sensitive to the speed of the temperature increase rather than just to the absolute temperature. These cellular and behavioral responses depended on the TRPA1 channel, whose activity responded to the rate of temperature increase. We propose that larvae use low-threshold sensors in the brain to monitor rapid temperature increases as a protective alert signal to trigger rolling behaviors, allowing fast escape before the temperature of the brain rises to dangerous levels.},

Low aptitude users showed no activation when observing movement. The number of activated voxels during motor observation was significantly correlated with accuracy in the EEG-BCI task (r=0.53). Furthermore, the number of activated voxels in the right middle frontal gyrus, an area responsible for processing of movement observation, correlated (r=0.72) with BCI-performance. This strong correlation highlights the importance of these areas for task monitoring and working memory as task goals have to be activated throughout the BCI session.The ability to regulate behavior and the brain through learning mechanisms involving imagery such as required to control a BCI constitutes the consequence of ideo-motor co-activation of motor brain systems during observation of movements. The results demonstrate that acquisition of a sensorimotor program reflected in SMR-BCI-control is tightly related to the recall of such sensorimotor programs during observation of movements and unrelated to the actual execution of these movement sequences. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Although microglia have been implicated in nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain, the manner by which injured sensory neurons engage microglia remains unclear. We found that peripheral nerve injury induced de novo expression of colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) in injured sensory neurons. CSF1 was transported to the spinal cord, where it targeted the microglial CSF1 receptor (CSF1R). Cre-mediated sensory neuron deletion of Csf1 completely prevented nerve injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and reduced microglial activation and proliferation. In contrast, intrathecal injection of CSF1 induced mechanical hypersensitivity and microglial proliferation. Nerve injury also upregulated CSF1 in motoneurons, where it was required for ventral horn microglial activation and proliferation. Downstream of CSF1R, we found that the microglial membrane adaptor protein DAP12 was required for both nerve injury- and intrathecal CSF1-induced upregulation of pain-related microglial genes and the ensuing pain, but not for microglial proliferation. Thus, both CSF1 and DAP12 are potential targets for the pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain.},

To further the study of synaptic function in a genetically tractable organism and to generate a tool to disable neuronal communication for behavioural studies, we have expressed a gene encoding tetanus toxin light chain in Drosophila. Toxin expression in embryonic neurons removes detectable synaptobrevin and eliminates evoked, but not spontaneous, synaptic vesicle release. No other developmental or morphological defects are detected. Correspondingly, only synaptobrevin (n-syb), but not the ubiquitously expressed syb protein, is cleaved by tetanus toxin in vitro. Targeted expression of toxin can produce specific behavioral defects; in one case, the olfactory escape response is reduced. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Courtship in Drosophila melanogaster has become an iconic example of an innate and interactive series of behaviors. The female signals her acceptance of copulation by becoming immobile in response to a male's display of stereotyped actions. The male and female communicate via vision, air-borne sounds, and pheromones, but what triggers the female's immobility is undetermined. Here, we describe an overlooked and important component of Drosophila courtship. Video recordings and laser vibrometry show that the male abdomen shakes ("quivers"), generating substrate-borne vibrations at about six pulses per second. We present evidence that the female becomes receptive and stops walking because she senses these vibrations, rather than as a response to air-borne songs produced by the male fluttering the wings. We also present evidence that the neural circuits expressing the sex-determination genes fruitless and doublesex drive quivering behavior. These abdominal quivers and associated vibrations, as well as their effect on female receptivity, are conserved in other Drosophila species. Substrate-borne vibrations are an ancient form of communication that is widespread in animals. Our findings in Drosophila open a door to study the neuromuscular circuitry responsible for these signals and the sensory systems needed for their reception.},

It is well known that exposing an organism to an altered visual environment often results in modification of the visual system of the organism. The field of perceptual learning provides many examples of training-induced increases in performance. But perceptual learning, when it occurs, tends to be specific to the trained task; that is, generalization to new tasks is rarely found. Here we show, by contrast, that action-video-game playing is capable of altering a range of visual skills. Four experiments establish changes in different aspects of visual attention in habitual video-game players as compared with non-video-game players. In a fifth experiment, non-players trained on an action video game show marked improvement from their pre-training abilities, thereby establishing the role of playing in this effect.},

abstract = {Ca(2+)-sensitive kinases are thought to play a role in long-term potentiation (LTP). To test the involvement of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaM-K II), truncated, constitutively active form of this kinase was directly injected into CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells. Inclusion of CaM-K II in the recording pipette resulted in a gradual increase in the size of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). No change in evoked responses occurred when the pipette contained heat-inactivated kinase. The effects of CaM-K II mimicked several features of LTP in that it caused a decreased incidence of synaptic failures, an increase in the size of spontaneous EPSCs, and an increase in the amplitude of responses to iontophoretically applied alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate. To determine whether the CaM-K II-induced enhancement and LTP share a common mechanism, occlusion experiments were carried out. The enhancing action of CaM-K II was greatly diminished by prior induction of LTP. In addition, following the increase in synaptic strength by CaM-K II, tetanic stimulation failed to evoke LTP. These findings indicate that CaM-K II alone is sufficient to augment synaptic strength and that this enhancement shares the same underlying mechanism as the enhancement observed with LTP.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoid hormones, acting via nuclear receptors, regulate many metabolic processes, including hepatic gluconeogenesis. It recently has been recognized that intracellular glucocorticoid concentrations are determined not only by plasma hormone levels, but also by intracellular 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11beta-HSDs), which interconvert active corticosterone (cortisol in humans) and inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone (cortisone in humans). 11beta-HSD type 2, a dehydrogenase, thus excludes glucocorticoids from otherwise nonselective mineralocorticoid receptors in the kidney. Recent data suggest the type 1 isozyme (11beta-HSD-1) may function as an 11beta-reductase, regenerating active glucocorticoids from circulating inert 11-keto forms in specific tissues, notably the liver. To examine the importance of this enzyme isoform in vivo, mice were produced with targeted disruption of the 11beta-HSD-1 gene. These mice were unable to convert inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone in vivo. Despite compensatory adrenal hyperplasia and increased adrenal secretion of corticosterone, on starvation homozygous mutants had attenuated activation of the key hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, presumably, because of relative intrahepatic glucocorticoid deficiency. The 11beta-HSD-1 -/- mice were found to resist hyperglycamia provoked by obesity or stress. Attenuation of hepatic 11beta-HSD-1 may provide a novel approach to the regulation of gluconeogenesis.},

abstract = {Signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) pathway is crucial for metabolic responses to insulin, and defects in PI3K signaling have been demonstrated in type 2 diabetes. PTEN (MMAC1) is a lipid/protein phosphatase that can negatively regulate the PI3K pathway by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate, but it is unclear whether PTEN is physiologically relevant to insulin signaling in vivo. We employed an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) strategy in an effort to specifically inhibit the expression of PTEN. Transfection of cells in culture with ASO targeting PTEN reduced PTEN mRNA and protein levels and increased insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in alpha-mouse liver-12 (AML12) cells. Systemic administration of PTEN ASO once a week in mice suppressed PTEN mRNA and protein expression in liver and fat by up to 90 and 75{\%}, respectively, and normalized blood glucose concentrations in db/db and ob/ob mice. Inhibition of PTEN expression also dramatically reduced insulin concentrations in ob/ob mice, improved the performance of db/db mice during insulin tolerance tests, and increased Akt phosphorylation in liver in response to insulin. These results suggest that PTEN plays a significant role in regulating glucose metabolism in vivo by negatively regulating insulin signaling.},

abstract = {Since its description more than fifteen years ago, the GAL4-UAS system of heterologous transgenic expression has found universal and widespread use in Drosophila research, making it a uniquely powerful analytical tool. Several hundreds of enhancer-trap GAL4 "driver" lines have since been used to express proteins of interest in specific spatio-temporal domains. However, the identities of enhancer elements that regulate GAL4 expression in vivo are often not known. Here, I report the mapping of three GAL4 lines commonly used as motor neuron drivers. Sequencing of genomic DNA flanking these three P-element transposon insertions, C380 (BG380), OK6 and D42, shows that these insertions lie upstream of the futsch, Rapgap1and toll-6 genes, respectively. Of the three, OK6-GAL4 (Rapgap1) expression is most restricted to motor neurons, while C380-GAL4 and D42-GAL4 also show prominent expression in the peripheral nervous system, including body wall sensory neurons. Next, I use available antibodies to Futsch and Rapgap1 to determine the extent to which expression patterns of these genes overlap with one another, and show that all three GAL4 lines express strongly in the nervous system, albeit with clear differences. Finally, I test if the highly restricted expression pattern of Futsch is maintained in six other species of Drosophilids (D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. simulans, D. willistoni and D. virilis). My results suggest conserved control of Futsch expression across species, most likely through upstream cis-acting elements. A comparative anatomy of the larval central nervous systems and peripheral innervation in these Drosophilid species as revealed by contemporary immunohistochemical markers is also presented. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this report, we describe the cellular, spatial, and temporal expression patterns of dsx gene products in the developing and adult CNS by applying RT-PCR and immunohistochemical procedures. dsx gene products were detected in the CNS of 3rd-instar larvae, pupae, and adults. DSX-immunoreactive signals were observed within the brain and in both the thoracic plus abdominal ganglia of the ventral nerve cord. Most, but not all, cells inferred to contain DSX proteins (by the results of genetic controls for antibody specificity) were further determined to be neurons (by coexpression of a protein that marks such CNS cell types). Temporally varying expression of DSX was most prominently observed in the rapidly metamorphosing early and mid-pupal stages, suggesting that this gene contributes to establishment of sexually dimorphic neuronal structures which subserve adult sexual behaviors. Elements of the spatial and temporal patterns of DSX immunoreactivity also imply that sexually dimorphic dsx expression in certain neuronal clusters within the adult CNS could participate in ongoing operations of the mature nervous system with respect to the courtship behaviors that are affected by dsx mutations.},

Here, we report that six neurosecretory cells in the Drosophila brain that produce Diuretic hormone 44 (Dh44), a homolog of the mammalian corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), were specifically activated by nutritive sugars. Flies in which the activity of these neurons or the expression of Dh44 was disrupted failed to select nutritive sugars. Manipulation of the function of Dh44 receptors had a similar effect. Notably, artificial activation of Dh44 receptor-1 neurons resulted in proboscis extensions and frequent episodes of excretion. Conversely, reduced Dh44 activity led to decreased excretion. Together, these actions facilitate ingestion and digestion of nutritive foods. We propose that the Dh44 system directs the detection and consumption of nutritive sugars through a positive feedback loop.},

abstract = {Motor neurons are the final stage of neural processing for the execution of motor behaviours. Traditionally, motor neurons have been viewed as the ‘final common pathway', serving as passive recipients merely conveying to the muscles the final motor program generated by upstream interneuron circuits1,2. Here we reveal an unforeseen role of motor neurons in controlling the locomotor circuit function via gap junctions in zebrafish. These gap junctions mediate a retrograde analogue propagation of voltage fluctuations from motor neurons to control the synaptic release and recruitment of the upstream V2a interneurons that drive locomotion. Selective inhibition of motor neurons during ongoing locomotion de- recruits V2a interneurons and strongly influences locomotor circuit function. Rather than acting as separate units, gap junctions unite motor neurons and V2a interneurons into functional ensembles endowed with a retrograde analogue computation essential for locomotor rhythm generation. These results show that motor neurons are not a passive recipient of motor commands but an integral component of the neural circuits responsible for motor behaviour.},

Thus, sensory neu- ron types can be defined by linking transcriptome-based neuron typing with the sensory phenotypes. Here we classify somatosensory neurons of the mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) by high-coverage single-cell RNA-sequencing (10 950 ± 1 218 genes per neuron) and neuron size-based hierarchical clustering. Moreover, single DRG neurons respond- ing to cutaneous stimuli are recorded using an in vivo whole-cell patch clamp technique and classified by neuron-type genetic markers. Small diameter DRG neurons are classified into one type of low-threshold mechanoreceptor and five types of mechanoheat nociceptors (MHNs). Each of the MHN types is further categorized into two subtypes. Large DRG neurons are categorized into four types, including neurexophilin 1-expressing MHNs and mechanical nocicep- tors (MNs) expressing BAI1-associated protein 2-like 1 (Baiap2l1). Mechanoreceptors expressing trafficking protein particle complex 3-like and Baiap2l1-marked MNs are subdivided into two subtypes each.

abstract = {Inheritance of 9 microsatellite loci was examined in 3 families of gynogenetic Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai produced by fertilizing eggs with UV-irradiated sperm followed by inhibition of the second meiotic division. The proportion of heterozygous progeny was used to estimate marker-centromere (M-C) distances. All loci conformed to Mendelian segregation in the control crosses when null alleles were accounted for. The absence of paternal alleles confirmed the gynogenetic origin of the offspring and indicated 100{\%} success for 3 families. Estimated recombinant frequencies ranged from 0.10 to 0.60, which is lower than those observed in other gynogenetic diploid animals. The mean recombination frequency was 0.22, corresponding to a fixation index of 0.78 in one generation. This is 3.12 times the increase in homozygosity expected after one generation of sib mating (0.25), suggesting meiotic gynogenesis may be an effective means of rapid inbreeding in the abalone. M-C map distances for the 9 loci varied between 5 and 30 cM under the assumption of complete interference. The information about M-C distances will be useful for future gene mapping in H. discus hannai.},

After rats acquired a fear memory by receiving mild footshocks in a shock zone on a track, we analyzed place cells when the animals were placed on the track again and displayed an apparent memory retrieval behavior: avoidance of the shock zone. We found that place cells representing the shock zone were reactivated, despite the fact that the animals did not enter the shock zone. This reactivation occurred in ripple-associated awake replay of place cell sequences encoding the paths from the animal's current positions to the shock zone but not in place cell sequences within individual cycles of theta oscillation. The result reveals a specific place-cell pattern underlying inhibitory avoidance behavior and provides strong evidence for the involvement of awake replay in fear memory retrieval. The},

abstract = {Obesity is an epidemic in Western society, and causes rapidly accelerating rates of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), functions as a 'fuel gauge' to monitor cellular energy status. We investigated the potential role of AMPK in the hypothalamus in the regulation of food intake. Here we report that AMPK activity is inhibited in arcuate and paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) by the anorexigenic hormone leptin, and in multiple hypothalamic regions by insulin, high glucose and refeeding. A melanocortin receptor agonist, a potent anorexigen, decreases AMPK activity in PVH, whereas agouti-related protein, an orexigen, increases AMPK activity. Melanocortin receptor signalling is required for leptin and refeeding effects on AMPK in PVH. Dominant negative AMPK expression in the hypothalamus is sufficient to reduce food intake and body weight, whereas constitutively active AMPK increases both. Alterations of hypothalamic AMPK activity augment changes in arcuate neuropeptide expression induced by fasting and feeding. Furthermore, inhibition of hypothalamic AMPK is necessary for leptin's effects on food intake and body weight, as constitutively active AMPK blocks these effects. Thus, hypothalamic AMPK plays a critical role in hormonal and nutrient-derived anorexigenic and orexigenic signals and in energy balance.},

Here, we use head-restrained zebrafish larvae to monitor subcellular Ca 2+ dynamics in Mauthner neurons, the startle command neurons, during startle habituation in vivo. Using the Ca 2+ reporter GCaMP6s, we find that the amplitude of Ca 2+ signals in the lateral dendrite of the Mauthner neuron determines startle probability and that depression of this dendritic activity rather than downstream inhibition mediates glycine and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor-dependent short-term habituation. Combined, our results suggest a model for habituation learning in which increased inhibitory drive from feedforward inhibitory neurons combined with decreased excitatory input from auditory afferents decreases dendritic and Mauthner neuron excitability.},

By directly recording TPCs in endolysosomes from wild-type and TPC double-knockout mice, here we show that, in contrast to previous conclusions, TPCs are in fact sodium-selective channels activated by PI(3,5)P2 and are not activated by NAADP. Moreover, the primary endolysosomal ion is Na+, not K+, as had been previously assumed. These findings suggest that the organellar membrane potential may undergo large regulatory changes and may explain the specificity of PI(3,5)P2 in regulating the fusogenic potential of intracellular organelles. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

To identify strategies by which animals execute precise actions using sparse motor networks, we imaged the activity of a complete ensemble of wing control muscles in intact, flying flies. Our experiments uncovered a remarkably efficient logic in which each of the four skeletal elements at the base of the wing are equipped with both large phasically active muscles capable of executing large changes and smaller tonically active muscles specialized for continuous fine-scaled adjustments. Based on the responses to a broad panel of visual motion stimuli, we have developed a model by which the motor array regulates aerodynamically functional features of wing motion. Video Abstract},

We argue that instead of trying to build a single model that captures the generic behavior of a neuron or circuit, it is beneficial to construct a population of models that captures the behavior of the population that provided the experimental data. Studying a population of models with different underlying structure and similar behaviors provides opportunities to discover unsuspected compensatory mechanisms that contribute to neuron and network function.},

abstract = {Dysfunction in the monoamine systems of serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) may causally be related to major depressive disorder (MDD). Monoamine depletion studies investigate the direct effects of monoamines on mood. Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) or para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) deplete 5-HT, acute phenylalanine/tyrosine depletion (APTD) or alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT) deplete NE/DA. Available depletion studies found conflicting results in heterogeneous populations: healthy controls, patients with previous MDD in remission and patients suffering from MDD. The decrease in mood after 5-HT and NE/DA depletion in humans is reviewed and quantified. Systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (1966-October 2006) and cross-references was carried out. Randomized studies applying ATD, PCPA, APTD or AMPT vs control depletion were included. Pooling of results by meta-analyses was stratified for studied population and design of the study (within or between subjects). Seventy-three ATD, 2 PCPA, 10 APTD and 8 AMPT studies were identified of which 45 ATD and 8 APTD studies could be meta-analyzed. 5-HT or NE/DA depletion did not decrease mood in healthy controls. 5-HT or NE/DA depletion slightly lowered mood in healthy controls with a family history of MDD. In drug-free patients with MDD in remission, a moderate mood decrease was found for ATD, without an effect of APTD. ATD induced relapse in patients with MDD in remission who used serotonergic antidepressants. In conclusion, monoamine depletion studies demonstrate decreased mood in subjects with a family history of MDD and in drug-free patients with MDD in remission, but do not decrease mood in healthy humans. Although depletion studies usefully investigate the etiological link of 5-HT and NE with MDD, they fail to demonstrate a causal relation. They presumably clarify a vulnerability trait to become depressed. Directions for further investigation of this vulnerability trait are proposed.},

These efforts have been motivated by the belief that similar synaptic modifications occur during memory formation, but it has never been shown that learning actually induces LTP in CA1. We found that one-trial inhibitory avoidance learning in rats produced the same changes in hippocampal glutamate receptors as induction of LTP with HFS and caused a spatially restricted increase in the amplitude of evoked synaptic transmission in CA1 in vivo. Because the learning-induced synaptic potentiation occluded HFS-induced LTP, we conclude that inhibitory avoidance training induces LTP in CA1.},

abstract = {Maladaptive plasticity within the dorsal horn (DH) of the spinal cord is a key substrate for development of neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury. Advances in genetic engineering, tracing techniques and opto-genetics are leading to a much better understanding of the complex circuitry of the spinal DH and the radical changes evoked in such circuitry by nerve injury. These changes can be viewed at multiple levels including: synaptic remodeling including enhanced excitatory and reduced inhibitory drive, morphological and electrophysiological changes which are observed both to primary afferent inputs as well as DH neurons, and ultimately circuit-level rewiring which leads to altered connectivity and aberrant processing of sensory inputs in the DH. The DH should not be seen in isolation but is subject to important descending modulation from the brainstem, which is further dysregulated by nerve injury. Understanding which changes relate to specific disease-states is essential, and recent work has aimed to stratify patient populations in a mechanistic fashion. In this review we will discuss how such pathophysiological mechanisms may lead to the distressing sensory phenomena experienced by patients suffering neuropathic pain, and the relationship of such mechanisms to current and potential future treatment modalities.},

We recorded single neurons in freely flying bats, using a wireless neural-telemetry system, and studied how hippocampal place cells encode 3D volumetric space during flight. Individual place cells were active in confined 3D volumes, and in {\textgreater}90{\%} of the neurons, all three axes were encoded with similar resolution. The 3D place fields from different neurons spanned different locations and collectively represented uniformly the available space in the room. Theta rhythmicity was absent in the firing patterns of 3D place cells. These results suggest that the bat hippocampus represents 3D volumetric space by a uniform and nearly isotropic rate code.},

The CRISPR-associated catalytically inactive dCas9 protein offers a general platform for RNA-guided DNA targeting. Here, we show that fusion of dCas9 to effector domains with distinct regulatory functions enables stable and efficient transcriptional repression or activation in human and yeast cells, with the site of delivery determined solely by a coexpressed short guide (sg)RNA. Coupling of dCas9 to a transcriptional repressor domain can robustly silence expression of multiple endogenous genes. RNA-seq analysis indicates that CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-mediated transcriptional repression is highly specific. Our results establish that the CRISPR system can be used as a modular and flexible DNA-binding platform for the recruitment of proteins to a target DNA sequence, revealing the potential of CRISPRi as a general tool for the precise regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a hardware and software communications system that permits cerebral activity alone to control computers or external devices. The immediate goal of BCI research is to provide communications capabilities to severely disabled people who are totally paralyzed or 'locked in' by neurological neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brain stem stroke, or spinal cord injury. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of BCIs, looking at the different steps that form a standard BCI: signal acquisition, preprocessing or signal enhancement, feature extraction, classification and the control interface. We discuss their advantages, drawbacks, and latest advances, and we survey the numerous technologies reported in the scientific literature to design each step of a BCI. First, the review examines the neuroimaging modalities used in the signal acquisition step, each of which monitors a different functional brain activity such as electrical, magnetic or metabolic activity. Second, the review discusses different electrophysiological control signals that determine user intentions, which can be detected in brain activity. Third, the review includes some techniques used in the signal enhancement step to deal with the artifacts in the control signals and improve the performance. Fourth, the review studies some mathematic algorithms used in the feature extraction and classification steps which translate the information in the control signals into commands that operate a computer or other device. Finally, the review provides an overview of various BCI applications that control a range of devices.},

abstract = {Courtship is pivotal to successful reproduction throughout the animal kingdom. Sexual differences in the nervous system are thought to underlie courtship behavior. Male courtship behavior in Drosophila is in large part regulated by the gene fruitless (fru). fru has been reported to encode at least three putative BTB-zinc-finger transcription factors predicted to have different DNA-binding specificities. Although a large number of previous studies have demonstrated that fru plays essential roles in male courtship behavior, we know little about the function of Fru isoforms at the molecular level. Our recent study revealed that male-specific Fru isoforms are expressed in highly overlapping subsets of neurons in the male brain and ventral nerve cord. Fru isoforms play both distinct and redundant roles in male courtship behavior. Importantly, we have identified for the first time, by means of the DamID technique, direct Fru transcriptional target genes. Fru target genes overwhelmingly represent genes previously reported to be involved in the nervous system development, such as CadN, lola and pdm2. Our study provides important insight into how the sexually dimorphic neural circuits underlying reproductive behavior are established.},

Moreover, single DRG neurons respond- ing to cutaneous stimuli are recorded using an in vivo whole-cell patch clamp technique and classified by neuron-type genetic markers. Small diameter DRG neurons are classified into one type of low-threshold mechanoreceptor and five types of mechanoheat nociceptors (MHNs). Each of the MHN types is further categorized into two subtypes. Large DRG neurons are categorized into four types, including neurexophilin 1-expressing MHNs and mechanical nocicep- tors (MNs) expressing BAI1-associated protein 2-like 1 (Baiap2l1). Mechanoreceptors expressing trafficking protein particle complex 3-like and Baiap2l1-marked MNs are subdivided into two subtypes each.

Simultaneous recording from two extracellular electrodes indicated neural (multiple unit) activity at two sites in the brain, one of which is in or near the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the other in one of many other brain locations. Both sites in intact rats displayed clear circadian rhythmicity of spontaneous neural activity. In experimental animals, a Halasz knife was used to create an island of hypothalamic tissue that contained the suprachiasmatic nuclei. In such animals that were also blinded by bilateral ocular enucleation, circadian rhythmicity was lost at all brain locations recorded outside the island, but it persisted within the island that contained the suprachiasmatic nuclei. The rhythmicity of the island is thus not dependent on afferent inputs from elsewhere in the brain.},

abstract = {Opioid receptors belong to the G protein coupled receptor family. They modulate brain function at all levels of neural integration and therefore impact on autonomous, sensory, emotional and cognitive processing. In vivo functional interaction between mu and delta opioid receptors are known to take place though it is still debated whether interactions occur at circuitry, cellular or molecular level. Also, the notion of receptor crosstalk via mu-delta heteromers is well documented in vitro but in vivo evidence remains scarce. To identify neurons in which receptor interactions could take place, we designed a unique double mutant knock-in mouse line that expresses functional red-fluorescent mu receptors and green-fluorescent delta receptors. We mapped mu and delta receptor distribution and co-localization throughout the nervous system and created the first interactive brain atlas with concomitant mu-delta visualization at subcellular resolution (http://mordor.ics-mci.fr/). Mu and delta receptors co-localize in neurons from subcortical networks but are mainly detected in separate neurons in the forebrain. Also, co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated physical proximity in the hippocampus, a prerequisite to mu-delta heteromerization. Altogether, data suggest that mu-delta functional interactions take place at systems level for high-order emotional and cognitive processing whereas mu-delta may interact at cellular level in brain networks essential for survival, which has potential implications for innovative drug design in pain control, drug addiction and eating disorders.},

abstract = {The reproductive biology of Drosophila melanogaster is described and critically discussed, primarily with regard to genetic studies of sex-specific behavior and its neural underpinnings. The investigatory history of this system includes, in addition to a host of recent neurobiological analyses of reproductive phenotypes, studies of mating as well as the behaviors leading up to that event. Courtship and mating have been delved into mostly with regard to male-specific behavior and biology, although a small number of studies has also pointed to the neural substrates of female reproduction. Sensory influences on interactions between courting flies have long been studied, partly by application of mutants and partly by surgical experiments. More recently, molecular-genetic approaches to sensations passing between flies in reproductive contexts have aimed to "dissect" further the meaning of separate sensory modalities. Notable among these are olfactory and contact-chemosensory stimuli, which perhaps have received an inordinate amount of attention in terms of the possibility that they could comprise the key cues involved in triggering and sustaining courtship actions. But visual and auditory stimuli are heavily involved as well--appreciated mainly from older experiments, but analyzable further using elementary approaches (single-gene mutations mutants and surgeries), as well as by applying the molecularly defined factors alluded to above. Regarding regulation of reproductive behavior by components of Drosophila's central nervous system (CNS), once again significant invigoration of the relevant inquiries has been stimulated and propelled by identification and application of molecular-genetic materials. A distinct plurality of the tools applied involves transposons inserted in the fly's chromosomes, defining "enhancer-trap" strains that can be used to label various portions of the nervous system and, in parallel, disrupt their structure and function by "driving" companion transgenes predesigned for these experimental purposes. Thus, certain components of interneuronal routes, functioning along pathways whose starting points are sensory reception by the peripheral nervous system (PNS), have been manipulated to enhance appreciation of sexually important sensory modalities, as well as to promote understanding of where such inputs end up within the CNS: Where are reproductively related stimuli processed, such that different kinds of sensation would putatively be integrated to mediate sex-specific behavioral readouts? In line with generic sensory studies that have tended to concentrate on chemical stimuli, PNS-to-CNS pathways focused upon in reproductive experiments relying on genic enhancers have mostly involved smell and taste. Enhancer traps have also been applied to disrupt various regions within the CNS to ask about the various ganglia, and portions thereof, that contribute to male- or female-specific behavior. These manipulations have encompassed structural or functional disruptions of such regions as well as application of molecular-genetic tricks to feminize or masculinize a given component of the CNS. Results of such experiments have, indeed, identified certain discrete subsets of centrally located ganglia that, on the one hand, lead to courtship defects when disrupted or, on the other, must apparently maintain sex-specific identity if the requisite courtship actions are to be performed. As just implied, perturbations of certain neural tissues not based on manipulating "sex factors" might lead to reproductive behavioral abnormalities, even though changing the sexual identity of such structures would not necessarily have analogous consequences. It has been valuable to uncover these sexually significant subsets of the Drosophila nervous system, although it must be said that not all of the transgenically based dissection outcomes are in agreement. Thus, the good news is that not all of the CNS is devoted to courtship control, whereby any and all locales disrupted might have led to sex-specific deficits; but the bad news is that the enhancer-trap approach to these matters has not led to definitive homing-in on some tractable number of mutually agreed-upon "courtship centers" within the brain or within the ventral nerve cord (VNC). The latter neural region, which comprises about half of the fly's CNS, is underanalyzed as to its sex-specific significance: How, for example, are various kinds of sensory inputs to posteriorly located PNS structures processed, such that they eventually end up modulating brain functions underlying courtship? And how are sex-specific motor outputs mediated by discrete collections of neurons within VNC ganglia--so that, for instance, male-specific whole-animal motor actions and appendage usages are evoked? These behaviors can be thought of as fixed action patterns. But it is increasingly appreciated that elements of the fly's reproductive behavior can be modulated by previous experience. In this regard, the neural substrates of conditioned courtship are being more and more analyzed, principally by further usages of various transgenic types. Additionally, a set of molecular neurogenetic experiments devoted to experience-dependent courtship was based on manipulations of a salient "sex gene" in D. melanogaster. This well-defined factor is called fruitless (fru). The gene, its encoded products, along with their behavioral and neurobiological significance, have become objects of frenetic attention in recent years. How normal, mutated, and molecularly manipulated forms of fru seem to be generating a good deal of knowledge and insight about male-specific courtship and mating is worthy of much attention. This previews the fact that fruitless matters are woven throughout this chapter as well as having a conspicuous section allocated to them. Finally, an acknowledgment that the reader is being subjected to lengthy preview of an article about this subject is given. This matter is mentioned because--in conjunction with the contemporary broadening and deepening of this investigatory area--brief summaries of its findings are appearing with increasing frequency. This chapter will, from time to time, present our opinion that a fair fraction of the recent minireviews are replete with too many catch phrases about what is really known. This is one reason why the treatment that follows not only attempts to describe the pertinent primary reports in detail but also pauses often to discuss our views about current understandings of sex-specific behavior in Drosophila and its underlying biology.},

Pairing of subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) with back-propagating action potentials resulted in an amplification of dendritic action potentials and evoked calcium influx near the site of synaptic input. This pairing also induced a robust LTP, which was reduced when EPSPs were paired with non-back-propagating action potentials or when stimuli were unpaired. Action potentials thus provide a synaptically controlled, associative signal to the dendrites for Hebbian modifications of synaptic strength.},

abstract = {Background: Developing neural networks display spontaneous and correlated rhythmic bursts of action potentials that are essential for circuit refinement. In the spinal cord, it is poorly understood how correlated activity is acquired and how its emergence relates to the formation of the spinal central pattern generator (CPG), the circuit that mediates rhythmic behaviors like walking and swimming. It is also unknown whether early, uncorrelated activity is necessary for the formation of the coordinated CPG. Results: Time-lapse imaging in the intact zebrafish embryo with the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP3 revealed a rapid transition from slow, sporadic activity to fast, ipsilaterally correlated, and contralaterally anticorrelated activity, characteristic of the spinal CPG. Ipsilateral correlations were acquired through the coalescence of local microcircuits. Brief optical manipulation of activity with the light-driven pump halorhodopsin revealed that the transition to correlated activity was associated with a strengthening of ipsilateral connections, likely mediated by gap junctions. Contralateral antagonism increased in strength at the same time. The transition to coordinated activity was disrupted by long-term optical inhibition of sporadic activity in motoneurons and ventral longitudinal descending interneurons and resulted in more neurons exhibiting uncoordinated activity patterns at later time points. Conclusions: These findings show that the CPG in the zebrafish spinal cord emerges directly from a sporadically active network as functional connectivity strengthens between local and then more distal neurons. These results also reveal that early, sporadic activity in a subset of ventral spinal neurons is required for the integration of maturing neurons into the coordinated CPG network. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

Injections restricted to superficial laminae (I/II) of dorsal horn were used primarily. For comparison, injections were also made in deep cervical laminae. Spinal and trigeminal lamina I neurons project extensively to restricted portions of the ventral posterolateral and posteromedial (VPL/VPM), and the posterior group (Po) thalamic nuclei. Lamina I also projects to the triangular posterior (PoT) and the ventral posterior parvicellular (VPPC) thalamic nuclei but only very slightly to the extrathalamic forebrain. Furthermore, the lateral spinal (LS) nucleus, and to a lesser extent lamina I, project to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. In contrast to lamina I, deep spinal laminae project primarily to the central lateral thalamic nucleus (CL) and only weakly to the remaining thalamus, except for a medium projection to the PoT. Furthermore, the deep laminae project substantially to the globus pallidus and the substantia innominata and more weakly to the amygdala and the hypothalamus. Double-labeling experiments reveal that spinal and trigeminal lamina I project densely to distinct and restricted portions of VPL/VPM, Po, and VPPC thalamic nuclei, whereas projections to the PoT appeared to be convergent. In conclusion, these experiments indicate very different patterns of projection for lamina I versus deep laminae (III-X). Lamina I projects strongly onto relay thalamic nuclei and thus would have a primary role in sensory discriminative aspects of pain. The deep laminae project densely to the CL and more diffusely to other forebrain targets, suggesting roles in motor and alertness components of pain.},

New optical, electrophysiological, and genetic methods allow detailed in vivo investigation of the superficial neocortical layers 2 and 3 (L2/3). Here, we review current knowledge of mouse L2/3 sensory cortex, focusing on somatosensory barrel cortex with comparisons to visual and auditory cortex. Broadly tuned, dense subthreshold synaptic input accompanied by sparse action potential (AP) firing in excitatory neurons provides a simple and reliable neural code useful for associative learning. Sparse AP firing is enforced by strong inhibition from genetically defined classes of GABAergic neurons. Subnetworks of strongly and specifically connected excitatory neurons may drive L2/3 network function, with potential contributions from dendritic spikes evoked by spatiotemporally clustered synaptic input. These functional properties of L2/3 are under profound regulation by brain state and behavior, providing interesting avenues for future mechanistic investigations into context-specific processing of sensory information},

Here we present an approach that allows imaging of whole fixed mouse brains. We modified 'ultramicroscopy' by combining it with a special procedure to clear tissue. We show that this new technique allows optical sectioning of fixed mouse brains with cellular resolution and can be used to detect single GFP-labeled neurons in excised mouse hippocampi. We obtained three-dimensional (3D) images of dendritic trees and spines of populations of CA1 neurons in isolated hippocampi. Also in fruit flies and in mouse embryos, we were able to visualize details of the anatomy by imaging autofluorescence. Our method is ideally suited for high-throughput phenotype screening of transgenic mice and thus will benefit the investigation of disease models.},

Today, genetically encoded indicators of neural Ca2+ dynamics are widely used, and those of trans-membrane voltage are rapidly improving. Two complementary imaging paradigms involve conventional microscopes for studying head-restrained animals and head-mounted miniature microscopes for imaging in freely behaving animals. Overall, the field has attained sufficient sophistication that increased cooperation between those designing new indicators, light sources, microscopes, and computational analyses would greatly benefit future progress.},

When elevating calcium ion concentration directly at the presynaptic terminal with the use of caged calcium, cleavage of SNAP-25 by botulinum toxin A (BoNT/A) produced a strong reduction in the calcium sensitivity for release, whereas cleavage of syntaxin using BoNT/C1 and synaptobrevin using tetanus toxin (TeNT) produced an all-or-nothing block without changing the kinetics of remaining vesicles. When stimulating release by calcium influx through channels, a difference between BoNT/C1 and TeNT emerged, which suggests that cleavage of synaptobrevin modifies the coupling between channels and release-competent vesicles.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that the interconversion of active and inactive glucocorticoids plays a key role in determining the specificity of the mineralocorticoid receptor and controlling local tissue glucocorticoid receptor activation. Two distinct isoforms of the enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD) have been identified. 11 beta-HSD1 is NADPH-dependent and at its major site of action (the liver) is a reductase, converting cortisone to cortisol (11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone in the rat). 11 beta-HSD2 is NAD-dependent, is present in tissues such as the kidney and placenta, and converts cortisol to cortisone (corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone in the rat). Congenital or acquired deficiency of 11 beta-HSD2 produces the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (SAME) in which cortisol gains access to the unprotected nonspecific mineralocorticoid receptor. The congenital deficiency is associated with mutations in the gene encoding the kidney isoform of 11 beta-HSD2; the acquired form results from inhibition of the enzyme by licorice, carbenoxolone, ACTH-dependent steroids in the ectopic ACTH syndrome, and possibly circulating inhibitors of the enzyme. This paper focuses on recent evidence, which suggest that low levels of placental 11 beta-HSD2 result in increased exposure of the fetus to maternal glucocorticoid and low birth weight. In animal studies using the rat we have shown that birth weight is correlated positively and placental weight negatively with the level of placental 11 beta-HSD. Thus animals with low birth weight and large placentae were those likely to be exposed to the highest level of maternal glucocorticoid. In man a similar relationship was found with birth weight being significantly correlated either with placental 11 beta-HSD activity or with the extent of cortisol inactivation by isolated perfused placental cotyledons. Administration of dexamethasone (which is poorly metabolized by placental 11 beta-HSD2) to pregnant rats resulted in decreased birth weight and the development of hypertension in the pups when adult. The same results were obtained when pregnant rats were given carbenoxolone, an inhibitor of placental 11 beta-HSD2. Low protein diet during pregnancy in the rat resulted in low birth weight of the pups, increased placental weight but decreased placental 11 beta-HSD activity, and adult hypertension. Thus increased glucocorticoid exposure of the fetus secondary to a failure of the normal inactivation of maternal glucocorticoid by the placental may be an important mechanism linking changes in the in utero environment and common adult diseases.},

abstract = {The mammalian circadian timing system consists of a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus, which is thought to set the phase of slave oscillators in virtually all body cells. However, due to the lack of appropriate in vivo recording technologies, it has been difficult to study how the SCN synchronizes oscillators in peripheral tissues. Here we describe the real-time recording of bioluminescence emitted by hepatocytes expressing circadian luciferase reporter genes in freely moving mice. The technology employs a device dubbed RT-Biolumicorder, which consists of a cylindrical cage with reflecting conical walls that channel photons toward a photomultiplier tube. The monitoring of circadian liver gene expression revealed that hepatocyte oscillators of SCN-lesioned mice synchronized more rapidly to feeding cycles than hepatocyte clocks of intact mice. Hence, the SCN uses signaling pathways that counteract those of feeding rhythms when their phase is in conflict with its own phase.},

The receptors that transduce these signals, and underlie these senses, are mechanically gated channels. Research on mechanosensation over the past decade, employing in many cases Drosophila as a model, has focused in typifying these receptors and in exploring the different ways, depending on context, in which these mechanosensors are modulated. In this review, we discuss first what we have learned from Drosophila on these mechanisms and we describe the different mechanosensory organs present in the Drosophila larvae and adult. Secondly, we focus on the progress obtained by studying the fly on the characterization of the mechanosensory crosstalk underlying complex behaviors like motor coordination. Finally, turning to a cellular level, we summarize what is known on the mechanical properties and sensing capabilities of neural cells and how they may affect neural physiology and pathology.},

abstract = {Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity is subject to negative feedback control by glucocorticoids. Although the rapid component of this feedback is widely considered to contribute to regulation of dynamic HPA activity, few in vivo data exist on the temporal and pharmacological characteristics of this phenomenon. Thus, frequent automated blood sampling was undertaken in rats to determine the effects of acute glucocorticoid administration on basal and stress-induced corticosterone secretion. The glucocorticoid agonist methylprednisolone (5-2000 $\mu$g) or dexamethasone (5-500 $\mu$g) injected iv at the peak of the diurnal rhythm caused dose-dependent suppression of basal corticosterone secretion, which was attenuated by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486. With 50 $\mu$g methylprednisolone, the onset of this suppression occurred at 40 min and remained significant for 120 min. However, although higher doses led to a greater and more sustained suppression of endogenous corticosterone, the response was delayed by the emergence of an initial stimulatory response that imposed a finite minimum delay. A corticosterone response to injection of CRH (1 $\mu$g, iv) during the period of maximal suppression indicated a suprapituitary site for the inhibitory effect glucocorticoid activation. This mechanism was supported by glucocorticoid injection immediately before a psychological stress (30 min, white noise); methylprednisolone caused dose-dependent attenuation of stress-induced corticosterone release and expression of the activity marker c-fos mRNA in the paraventricular nucleus but did not block the pituitary response to CRH. Thus, in rats, glucocorticoid receptor activation rapidly suppresses basal and stress-induced HPA activity that operates, at least in part, through a central mechanism of action.},

abstract = {In mammals, peripheral circadian clocks are present in most tissues, but little is known about how these clocks are synchronized with the ambient 24-h cycles. By using rat-1 fibroblasts, a model cell system of the peripheral clock, we found that an exchange of the culture medium triggered circadian gene expression that was preceded by slow down-regulation of Per1 and Per2 mRNA levels. This profile contrasts to the immediate up-regulation of these genes often observed for clock resetting. The screening of factor(s) responsible for the down-regulation revealed glucose as a key component triggering the circadian rhythm. The requirement of both glucose metabolism and RNA/protein synthesis for the down-regulation suggests the involvement of gene(s) immediately up-regulated by glucose metabolism. An analysis with high density oligonucleotide microarrays identified {\textgreater}100 glucose-regulated genes. We found among others immediately up-regulated genes encoding transcriptional regulators TIEG1, VDUP1, and HES1, in addition to cooperatively regulated genes that are associated with cholesterol biosynthesis and cell cycle. The immediate up-regulation of Tieg1 and Vdup1 expression was dependent on glucose metabolism but not on protein synthesis, suggesting that the transcriptional regulators mediate the glucose-induced down-regulation of Per1 and Per2 expression. These results illustrate a novel mode of peripheral clock resetting by external glucose, a major food metabolite.},

Thus, both machine learning and computational neuroscience are faced with a shared challenge: how can we analyze their representations in order to understand how they solve complex tasks? We review how data-analysis concepts and techniques developed by computational neuroscientists can be useful for analyzing representations in DNNs, and in turn, how recently developed techniques for analysis of DNNs can be useful for understanding representations in biological neural networks. We explore opportunities for synergy between the two fields, such as the use of DNNs as in silico model systems for neuroscience, and how this synergy can lead to new hypotheses about the operating principles of biological neural networks.},

After neuroleptic medication was changed to haloperidol, the rest-activity cycle became completely arrhythmic for two months, concomitant with a marked worsening of cognitive state. Circadian integrity returned together with clinical improvement when the patient was subsequently treated with clozapine. This observation suggests that the known tendency for patients with Alzheimer disease to develop sleep-wake cycle disturbances may be aggravated by a classic neuroleptic; in contrast, the atypical neuroleptic clozapine may consolidate it. Similar observations in schizophrenic patients indicate that this chronobiological finding is drug- and not illness-related.},

The anatomical and functional specificity of such long-range interactions and their role in learning is poorly understood. The amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are interconnected brain structures involved in the extinction of conditioned fear. Here, we show that a defined subpopulation of basal amygdala (BA) projection neurons targeting the prelimbic (PL) subdivision of mPFC is active during states of high fear, whereas BA neurons targeting the infralimbic (IL) subdivision are recruited, and exhibit cell-type-specific plasticity, during fear extinction. Pathway-specific optogenetic manipulations demonstrate that the activity balance between pathways is causally involved in fear extinction. Together, our findings demonstrate that, although intermingled locally, long-range connectivity defines distinct subpopulations of amygdala projection neurons and indicate that the formation of long-term extinction memories depends on the balance of activity between two defined amygdala-prefrontal pathways. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The brain receives sensory input from diverse peripheral tissues, including the skin, the body's largest sensory organ. Using genetically encoded axonal tracers expressed from the Mrgprd locus, we identify a subpopulation of nonpeptidergic, nociceptive neurons that project exclusively to the skin, and to no other peripheral tissue examined. Surprisingly, Mrgprd+ innervation is restricted to the epidermis and absent from specialized sensory structures. Furthermore, Mrgprd+ fibers terminate in a specific layer of the epidermis, the stratum granulosum. This termination zone is distinct from that innervated by most CGRP+ neurons, revealing that peptidergic and nonpeptidergic epidermal innervation is spatially segregated. The central projections deriving from these distinct epidermal innervation zones terminate in adjacent laminae in the dorsal spinal cord. Thus, afferent input from different layers of the epidermis is conveyed by topographically segregated sensory circuits, suggesting that at least some aspects of sensory information processing may be organized along labeled lines.},

abstract = {Neuropathic pain is characterized by mechanical allodynia induced by low-threshold myelinated A$\beta$-fiber activation. The original gate theory of pain proposes that inhibitory interneurons in the lamina II of the spinal dorsal horn (DH) act as "gate control" units for preventing the interaction between innocuous and nociceptive signals. However, our understanding of the neuronal circuits underlying pain signaling and modulation in the spinal DH is incomplete. Using a rat model, we have shown that the convergence of glycinergic inhibitory and excitatory A$\beta$-fiber inputs onto PKC$\gamma$+ neurons in the superficial DH forms a feed-forward inhibitory circuit that prevents A$\beta$ input from activating the nociceptive pathway. This feed-forward inhibition was suppressed following peripheral nerve injury or glycine blockage, leading to inappropriate induction of action potential outputs in the nociceptive pathway by A$\beta$-fiber stimulation. Furthermore, spinal blockage of glycinergic synaptic transmission in vivo induced marked mechanical allodynia. Our findings identify a glycinergic feed-forward inhibitory circuit that functions as a gate control to separate the innocuous mechanoreceptive pathway and the nociceptive pathway in the spinal DH. Disruption of this glycinergic inhibitory circuit after peripheral nerve injury has the potential to elicit mechanical allodynia, a cardinal symptom of neuropathic pain.},

abstract = {1. We have determined in adrenalectomized male rats the effects of clamping plasma corticosterone and aldosterone at various concentrations on corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), neurotensin/neuromedin N (NT/N) and proenkephalin (pENK) mRNAs in the hypothalamus and amygdala using semi-quantitative in situ hybridization. 2. Corticosterone differentially regulated the levels of CRH and NT/N but not pENK mRNA. These effects were cell specific. CRH mRNA was reduced in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVH), but increased in the central nucleus of the amygdala and bed nuclei of the stria terminalis. NT/N mRNA was never seen in the PVH, whereas levels increased in the central nucleus of the amygdala, but were unaffected in the lateral hypothalamic area. In those regions expressing pENK mRNA, levels were unaffected in all treatment groups. 3. CRH mRNA in both the central nucleus of the amygdala and PVH, and NT/N mRNA in the central nucleus of the amygdala were most sensitive to plasma corticosterone concentrations of less than 120 ng ml-1, i.e. those seen away from the peak of the diurnal rhythm. In adrenalectomized animals CRH mRNA in both the central nucleus of the amygdala and PVH could be set at levels usually seen in intact animals by the same plasma concentration of corticosterone. 4. The levels of CRH mRNA in the PVH and the central nucleus of the amygdala were closely correlated, while CRH and NT/N mRNA levels were similarly correlated in the central nucleus of the amygdala suggesting the existence of a common regulatory mechanism. The ED50 of their responses to corticosterone and correlations with thymus weight suggested the operation of glucocorticoid (type II) receptor mechanisms. 5. In the absence of corticosterone, aldosterone increased CRH and NT/N mRNA accumulation in the central nucleus of the amygdala, and increased CRH but not NT/N mRNA accumulation in the PVH. Aldosterone also blunted the dose-response effects of corticosterone on CRH and NT/N mRNA levels in the central nucleus of the amygdala, but not in the PVH. 6. These results suggest that, in intact animals, adrenal steroids play a major role in maintaining the levels of neuropeptide mRNAs in the PVH, bed nuclei of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala. The results underscore the importance of cell-specific mechanisms operating to regulate the expression of neuropeptide genes in different cell types in response to diverse physiological conditions.},

Here, we demonstrate that the miR-310-313 cluster is required for normal synaptic transmission at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction. Loss of miR-310-313 cluster leads to a significant enhancement of neurotransmitter release, which can be rescued with temporally restricted expression of mir-310-313 in larval presynaptic neurons. Kinesin family member, Khc-73 is a functional target for miR-310-313 as its expression is increased in mir-310-313 mutants and reducing it restores normal synaptic function. Cluster mutants show an increase in the active zone protein Bruchpilot accompanied by an increase in electron dense T bars. Finally, we show that repression of Khc-73 by miR-310-313 cluster influences the establishment of normal synaptic homeostasis. Our findings establish a role for miRNAs in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Although numerous theoretical models for sequential action generation have been proposed, few have been supported by the identification of control neurons sufficient to elicit a sequence. Here, we identify a pair of descending neurons that coordinate a stereotyped sequence of engagement actions during Drosophila melanogaster male courtship behavior. These actions are initiated sequentially but persist cumulatively, a feature not explained by existing models of sequential behaviors. We find evidence consistent with a ramp-to-threshold mechanism, in which increasing neuronal activity elicits each action independently at successively higher activity thresholds.},

abstract = {The development of new techniques to study glial cells has revealed that they are active participants in the development of functional neuronal circuits. Calcium imaging studies demonstrate that glial cells actively sense and respond to neuronal activity. Glial cells can produce and release neurotransmitter-like molecules, referred to as gliotransmitters, that can in turn influence the activity of neurons and other glia. One putative gliotransmitter, D-serine is believed to be an endogenous co-agonist for synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity mediated by this receptor. The observation that D-serine levels in the mammalian brain increase during early development, suggests a possible role for this gliotransmitter in normal brain development and circuit refinement. In this review we will examine the data that D-serine and its associated enzyme serine racemase are developmentally regulated. We will consider the evidence that D-serine is actively released by glial cells and examine the studies that have implicated D-serine as a critical player involved in regulating NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission and neuronal migration during development. Furthermore, we will consider how dysregulation of D-serine may play an important role in the etiology of neurological and psychiatric diseases.},

abstract = {Small animals use sensory information to navigate their environment in order to reach more favorable conditions. in gradients of light, temperature, odors and CO2, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Drosophila{\textless}/i{\textgreater} larvae alternate periods of runs and turns, regulating the frequency size and direction of turns, to move in a favorable direction. Whether larvae use the same strategies when navigating in response to somatosensory input is unknown. Further, while many of the sensory neurons that mediate navigation behaviors have been described, where and how these navigational strategies are implemented in the central nervous system and controlled by neuronal circuit elements is not well known. Here we characterize for the first time the navigational strategies of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Drosophila{\textless}/i{\textgreater} larvae in gradients of air-current speeds using high-throughput behavioral assays and quantitative behavioral analysis. We find that larvae extend runs towards favorable directions and shorten runs in unfavorable directions, and that larvae regulate both the direction and amplitudes of turns. These results suggest similar central decision-making mechanisms underlie navigation behaviors in somatosensory and other sensory modalities. By silencing the activity of individual neurons and very sparse expression patterns (2 or 3 neuron types), we further identify the sensory neurons and circuit elements in the ventral nerve cord and brain of the larva required for navigational decisions during anemotaxis. The phenotypes of these central neurons are consistent with a mechanism where the increase of the turning rate in unfavorable conditions and decrease in turning rate in favorable conditions are independently controlled. In addition, we find phenotypes that suggest that the decisions of whether and which way to turn are controlled independently. Our study reveals that different neuronal modules in the nerve cord and brain mediate different aspects of navigational decision making. The neurons identified in our screen provide a basis for future detailed mechanistic understanding of the circuit principles of navigational decision-making.},

abstract = {The Drosophila ventral nerve cord (VNC) derives from neuroblasts (NBs), which mostly divide in a stem cell mode and give rise to defined NB lineages characterized by specific sets of sequentially generated neurons and/or glia cells. To understand how different cell types are generated within a NB lineage, we have focused on the NB7-3 lineage as a model system. This NB gives rise to four individually identifiable neurons and we show that these cells are generated from three different ganglion mother cells (GMCs). The finding that the transcription factor Hunchback (Hb) is expressed in the early sublineage of NB7-3, which consists of the early NB and the first GMC (GMC7-3a) and its progeny (EW1 and GW), prompted us to investigate its possible role in NB7-3 lineage development. Our analysis revealed that loss of hb results in a lack of the normally Hb-positive neurons, while the later-born neurons (designated as EW2 and EW3) are still present. However, overexpression of hb in the whole lineage leads to additional cells with the characteristics of GMC7-3a-derived neurons, at the cost of EW2 and EW3. Thus, hb is an important determinant in specifying early sublineage identity in the NB7-3 lineage. Using Even-skipped (Eve) as a marker, we have additionally shown that hb is also needed for the determination and/or differentiation of several other early-born neurons, indicating that this gene is an important player in sequential cell fate specification within the Drosophila CNS.},

abstract = {The recently discovered orexigenic peptide ghrelin is produced primarily by the stomach and circulates in blood at levels that increase during prolonged fasting in rats. When administered to rodents at supraphysiological doses, ghrelin activates hypothalamic neuropeptide Y/agouti gene-related protein neurons and increases food intake and body weight. These findings suggest that ghrelin may participate in meal initiation. As a first step to investigate this hypothesis, we sought to determine whether circulating ghrelin levels are elevated before the consumption of individual meals in humans. Ghrelin, insulin, and leptin were measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma samples drawn 38 times throughout a 24-h period in 10 healthy subjects provided meals on a fixed schedule. Plasma ghrelin levels increased nearly twofold immediately before each meal and fell to trough levels within 1 h after eating, a pattern reciprocal to that of insulin. Intermeal ghrelin levels displayed a diurnal rhythm that was exactly in phase with that of leptin, with both hormones rising throughout the day to a zenith at 0100, then falling overnight to a nadir at 0900. Ghrelin levels sampled during the troughs before and after breakfast correlated strongly with 24-h integrated area under the curve values (r = 0.873 and 0.954, respectively), suggesting that these convenient, single measurements might serve as surrogates for 24-h profiles to estimate overall ghrelin levels. Circulating ghrelin also correlated positively with age (r = 0.701). The clear preprandial rise and postprandial fall in plasma ghrelin levels support the hypothesis that ghrelin plays a physiological role in meal initiation in humans.},

abstract = {The spatio-temporal proliferation pattern of postembryonic neuroblasts in the central brain region of the supra-esophageal ganglion of Drosophila melanogaster was studied by labeling DNA replicating cells with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU). There are five proliferating neuroblasts per hemisphere in larvae just after hatching: one in the ventro-lateral, and the other four in the postero-dorsal region of the brain. Dividing neuroblasts increase during the late first-late second instar larval stages, reaching a plateau of about 85 neuroblasts per hemisphere. Most neuroblasts cease dividing 20-30 hr after puparium formation (APF), while only four in the postero-dorsal region continue making progenies until 85-90 hr APF. The four distinct neuroblasts proliferating in the early larval and late pupal stages are identical; they lie in the cortex above the calyces of the mushroom bodies (corpora pedunculata), proliferating over a period twice as long as that for the other neuroblasts. Their daughter neurons project into the mushroom body neuropile, and hence are likely to be the Kenyon cells. The cell-cycle period of the four neuroblasts (named mushroom body neuroblasts: MBNbs) is rather constant (1.1-1.5 hr) during the mid larval-early pupal stages and is longer before and after that. The total number of the MBNb progenies made throughout the embryonic and postembryonic development was estimated to be 800-1200 per hemisphere.},

abstract = {The FLP protein of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasmid 2 microns circle catalyzes site-specific recombination between two repeated segments present on the plasmid. In this paper we present results of experiments we performed to define more precisely the features of the FLP recognition target site, which we propose to designate FRT, and to determine the actual recombination crossover point in vivo. We found that essential sequences for the recombination event are limited to an 8-base-pair core sequence and two 13-base-pair repeated units immediately flanking it. This is the region identified as the FLP binding site in vitro and at which FLP protein promotes specific single-strand cleavages (B. J. Andrews, G. A. Proteau, L. G. Beatty, and P. D. Sadowski, Cell 40:795-803, 1985; J. F. Senecoff, R. C. Bruckner, and M. M. Cox, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:7270-7274, 1985). Mutations within the core domain can be suppressed by the presence of the identical mutation in the chromatid with which it recombines. However, mutations outside the core are not similarly suppressed. We found that strand exchange during FLP recombination occurs most of the time within the core region, proceeding through a heteroduplex intermediate. Finally, we found that most FLP-mediated events are reciprocal exchanges and that FLP-catalyzed gene conversions occur at low frequency. The low level of gene conversion associated with FLP recombination suggests that it proceeds by a breakage-joining reaction and that the two events are concerted.},

abstract = {1. Capsaicin, the algesic substance in chilli peppers, was injected intradermally in healthy human subjects. A dose of 100 micrograms given in a volume of 10 microliters caused intense pain lasting for a few minutes after injection and resulted in a narrow area of hyperalgesia to heat and a wide surrounding area of hyperalgesia to mechanical stimuli (stroking) lasting for 1-2 h. 2. Nerve compression experiments with selective block of impulse conduction in myelinated (A) but not in unmyelinated (C) fibres indicated that afferent signals in C fibres contributed to pain from capsaicin injection and to heat hyperalgesia, whereas conduction in afferent A fibres was necessary for the perception of mechanical hyperalgesia. 3. Electrical intraneural microstimulation normally eliciting non-painful tactile sensations was accompanied by pain when the sensation was projected to skin areas within the region of mechanical hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin injection. 4. The threshold for pain evoked by intraneural microstimulation was reversibly lowered and pain from suprathreshold stimulation was exaggerated during the period of mechanical hyperalgesia, regardless of lidocaine anaesthesia of the cutaneous innervation territory of the stimulated fibres. 5. The results indicate that hyperalgesia to stroking on a skin area surrounding a painful intradermal injection of capsaicin is due to reversible changes in the central processing of mechanoreceptive input from myelinated fibres which normally evoke non-painful tactile sensations.},

While the role of biochemical signals has long been appreciated, the importance of biophysical signals has only recently been investigated. Biophysical cues are presented in different forms including topography and mechanical stiffness imparted by the extracellular matrix and adjoining cells. Microfabrication technologies have allowed for the generation of biomaterials with microscale topographies to study the effect of biophysical cues on cellular function at the cell-substrate interface. Topographies of different geometries and with varying microscale dimensions have been used to better understand cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation at the cellular and sub-cellular scales. Furthermore, quantification of cell-generated forces has been illustrated with micropillar topographies to shed light on the process of mechanotransduction. In this review, we highlight recent advances made in these areas and how they have been utilized for neural, cardiac, and musculoskeletal tissue engineering application. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Variation was measured in samples of populations of species from four plant families including tropical, temperate and cosmopolitan taxa. Populations of species of Asclepiadaceae, Bromeliaceae, Leguminosae and Umbelliferae were sampled. Employing a simple application of numerical phenetics and tested character lists, estimates of within-group overall variation were made. The coefficients of phenetic variation (CPV) are compared among the various groups. The groups considered are populations as well as taxa at several levels in the classification hierarchy, although in all cases, individuals sampled randomly from putative populations are the operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A small number of individuals is employed with a large number of characters. This application of numerical phenetics serves both alpha taxonomic and biosystematic goals and an OTU x OTU matrix of distance values is the basis for obtaining estimates of a population's variability. The phenetic distances between OTUs are the variates. Distinct trends of within-group variation are consistent as they were revealed in the four families. Intrapopulational coefficient of phenetic variation for populations of the tropical family Bromeliaceae is estimated as nearly double that for the other three families. The intraspecific variation as portrayed by CPV in the Asclepiadaceae and Leguminosae is about half that for the tropical family, Bromeliaceae. As sampled a clear distinction is evidenced in the change in variation between various taxonomic ranks for the families. The difference in CPV between the intrapopulational and intraspecific levels for the Leguminosae and Bromeliaceae is nearly double the difference between these two ranks for the Asclepiadaceae. Results show that the method has descriptive and heuristic value for systematics.},

abstract = {Signal relay by guidance receptors at the axonal growth cone is a process essential for the assembly of a functional nervous system. We investigated the in vivo function of Src family kinases (SFKs) as growth cone guidance signaling intermediates in the context of spinal lateral motor column (LMC) motor axon projection toward the ventral or dorsal limb mesenchyme. Using in situ mRNA detection we determined that Src and Fyn are expressed in LMC motor neurons of chick and mouse embryos at the time of limb trajectory selection. Inhibition of SFK activity by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) overexpression in chick LMC axons using in ovo electroporation resulted in LMC axons selecting the inappropriate dorsoventral trajectory within the limb mesenchyme, with medial LMC axon projecting into the dorsal and ventral limb nerve with apparently random incidence. We also detected LMC axon trajectory choice errors in Src mutant mice demonstrating a nonredundant role for Src in motor axon guidance in agreement with gain and loss of Src function in chick LMC neurons which led to the redirection of LMC axons. Finally, Csk-mediated SFK inhibition attenuated the retargeting of LMC axons caused by EphA or EphB over-expression, implying the participation of SFKs in Eph-mediated LMC motor axon guidance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that SFKs are essential for motor axon guidance and suggest that they play an important role in relaying ephrin:Eph signals that mediate the selection of motor axon trajectory in the limb.},

abstract = {We have used dye fills and electrophysiological recordings to identify and characterize a cluster of motor neurons in the third instar larval ventral ganglion. This cluster of neurons is similar in position to the well-studied embryonic RP neurons. Dye fills of larval dorsomedial neurons demonstrate that individual neurons within the cluster can be reproducibly identified by observing their muscle targets and bouton morphology. The terminal targets of these five neurons are body wall muscles 6/7, 1, 14, and 30 and the intersegmental nerve (ISN) terminal muscles (1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 19, 20). All cells except the ISN neuron, which has a type Is ending, display type Ib boutons. Two of these neurons appear to be identical to the embryonic RP3 and aCC cells, which define the most proximal and distal innervations within a hemisegment. The targets of the other neurons in the larval dorsomedial cluster do not correspond to embryonic targets of the neurons in the RP cluster, suggesting rewiring of this circuit during early larval stages. Electrophysiological studies of the five neurons in current clamp revealed that type Is neurons have a longer delay in the appearance of the first spike compared with type Ib neurons. Genetic, biophysical, and pharmacological studies in current and voltage clamp show this delay is controlled by the kinetics and voltage sensitivity of inactivation of a current whose properties suggest that it may be the Shal I(A) current. The combination of genetic identification and whole cell recording allows us to directly explore the cellular substrates of neural and locomotor behavior in an intact system.},

We performed simultaneous two-photon optogenetic activation and calcium imaging by coexpression of a red-shifted opsin and a genetically encoded calcium indicator. A spatial light modulator allows tens of user- selected neurons to be targeted for spatiotemporally precise concurrent optogenetic activation, while simultaneous fast calcium imaging provides high-resolution network-wide readout of the manipulation with negligible optical cross-talk. Proof-of-principle experiments in mouse barrel cortex demonstrate interrogation of the same neuronal population during different behavioral states and targeting of neuronal ensembles based on their functional signature. This approach extends the optogenetic toolkit beyond the specificity obtained with genetic or viral approaches, enabling high-throughput, flexible and long-term optical interrogation of functionally defined neural circuits with single-cell and single-spike resolution in the mouse brain in vivo},

abstract = {Spinal motor neurons (MNs) control diverse motor tasks including respiration, posture and locomotion that are disrupted by neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy. Methods directing MN differentiation from stem cells have been developed to enable disease modelling in vitro. However, most protocols produce only a limited subset of endogenous MN subtypes. Here we demonstrate that limb-innervating lateral motor column (LMC) MNs can be efficiently generated from mouse and human embryonic stem cells through manipulation of the transcription factor Foxp1. Foxp1-programmed MNs exhibit features of medial and lateral LMC MNs including expression of specific motor pool markers and axon guidance receptors. Importantly, they preferentially project axons towards limb muscle explants in vitro and distal limb muscles in vivo upon transplantation–hallmarks of bona fide LMC MNs. These results present an effective approach for generating specific MN populations from stem cells for studying MN development and disease.},

abstract = {Learning is mediated by experience-dependent plasticity in neuronal circuits. Activity in neuronal circuits is tightly regulated by different subtypes of inhibitory interneurons, yet their role in learning is poorly understood. Using a combination of in vivo single-unit recordings and optogenetic manipulations, we show that in the mouse basolateral amygdala, interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) bidirectionally control the acquisition of fear conditioning--a simple form of associative learning--through two distinct disinhibitory mechanisms. During an auditory cue, PV(+) interneurons are excited and indirectly disinhibit the dendrites of basolateral amygdala principal neurons via SOM(+) interneurons, thereby enhancing auditory responses and promoting cue-shock associations. During an aversive footshock, however, both PV(+) and SOM(+) interneurons are inhibited, which boosts postsynaptic footshock responses and gates learning. These results demonstrate that associative learning is dynamically regulated by the stimulus-specific activation of distinct disinhibitory microcircuits through precise interactions between different subtypes of local interneurons.},

Naturally occurring herpes and rabies viruses have been used for transneuronal circuit tracing for decades. Depending on the type of virus and strain, virus can travel preferentially in the anterograde or the retrograde direction. More recently, genetic modifications have allowed for many improvements. These include: reduced pathogenicity; addition of marker genes; control of synaptic spread; pseudotyping for infection of selected cells; addition of ancillary genetic elements for combining circuit tracing with manipulation of activity or functional assays. These modifications, along with the likelihood of future developments, suggest that neurotropic viruses will be increasingly important and effective tools for future studies of neural circuits. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Grey and white-matter regions were distinguishable owing to the different distribution of myelin in the brain tissue. THz images corresponded closely with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results. The MRI and hematoxylin and eosin-stained microscopic images were investigated to account for the intensity differences in the THz images for fresh and paraffin-embedded brain tissue. Our results indicated that the THz signals corresponded to the cell density when water was removed.

abstract = {Here we describe a set of straightforward laboratory exercises that integrate the study of genetics, neuroanatomy, cellular physiology and animal behavior. We use genetic tools in Drosophila for visualizing and remotely activating ensembles of neurons with heat pulses. First, we show how to examine the anatomy of several neuronal populations using genetically encoded green fluorescent protein. Next we demonstrate how to use the warmth gated Drosophila TRPA1 (dTRPA1) cation channel to remotely activate neural circuits in flies. To demonstrate the cellular effects of dTRPA1 activation, we expressed dTRPA1 panneurally and recorded excitatory junctional potentials in muscles in response to warmed (29°C) saline. Finally, we present inexpensive techniques for delivering heat pulses to activate dTRPA1 in the neuronal groups we observed previously while flies are freely behaving. We suggest how to film and quantify resulting behavioral phenotypes with limited resources. Activating all neurons with dTRPA1 caused tetanic paralysis in larvae, while in adults it led to paralysis in males and continuous uncoordinated leg and wing movements in females. Activation of cholinergic neurons produced spasms and writhing in larvae while causing paralysis in adults. When a single class of nociceptive sensory neurons was activated, it caused lateral rolling in larvae, but no discernable effects in adults. Overall, these exercises illustrate principles of modern genetics, neuroanatomy, the ionic basis of neuronal excitability, and quantitative methods in neuroethology. Relatively few research studies have used dTRPA1 to activate neural circuits, so these exercises give students opportunities to test novel hypotheses and make actual contributions to the scientific record.},

abstract = {Rhythmic motor patterns underlying many types of locomotion are thought to be produced by central pattern generators (CPGs). Our knowledge of how CPG networks generate motor patterns in complex nervous systems remains incomplete, despite decades of work in a variety of model organisms. Substrate borne locomotion in Drosophila larvae is driven by waves of muscular contraction that propagate through multiple body segments. We use the motor circuitry underlying crawling in larval Drosophila as a model to try to understand how segmentally coordinated rhythmic motor patterns are generated. Whereas muscles, motoneurons and sensory neurons have been well investigated in this system, far less is known about the identities and function of interneurons. Our recent study identified a class of glutamatergic premotor interneurons, PMSIs (period-positive median segmental interneurons), that regulate the speed of locomotion. Here, we report on the identification of a distinct class of glutamatergic premotor interneurons called Glutamatergic Ventro-Lateral Interneurons (GVLIs). We used calcium imaging to search for interneurons that show rhythmic activity and identified GVLIs as interneurons showing wave-like activity during peristalsis. Paired GVLIs were present in each abdominal segment A1-A7 and locally extended an axon towards a dorsal neuropile region, where they formed GRASP-positive putative synaptic contacts with motoneurons. The interneurons expressed vesicular glutamate transporter (vGluT) and thus likely secrete glutamate, a neurotransmitter known to inhibit motoneurons. These anatomical results suggest that GVLIs are premotor interneurons that locally inhibit motoneurons in the same segment. Consistent with this, optogenetic activation of GVLIs with the red-shifted channelrhodopsin, CsChrimson ceased ongoing peristalsis in crawling larvae. Simultaneous calcium imaging of the activity of GVLIs and motoneurons showed that GVLIs' wave-like activity lagged behind that of motoneurons by several segments. Thus, GVLIs are activated when the front of a forward motor wave reaches the second or third anterior segment. We propose that GVLIs are part of the feedback inhibition system that terminates motor activity once the front of the motor wave proceeds to anterior segments.},

abstract = {Drosophila larvae crawl by peristaltic waves of muscle contractions, which propagate along the animal body and involve the simultaneous contraction of the left and right side of each segment. Coordinated propagation of contraction does not require sensory input, suggesting that movement is generated by a central pattern generator (CPG). We characterized crawling behavior of newly hatched Drosophila larvae by quantifying timing and duration of segmental boundary contractions. We developed a CPG network model that recapitulates these patterns based on segmentally repeated units of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neuronal populations coupled with immediate neighboring segments. A single network with symmetric coupling between neighboring segments succeeded in generating both forward and backward propagation of activity. The CPG network was robust to changes in amplitude and variability of connectivity strength. Introducing sensory feedback via "stretch-sensitive" neurons improved wave propagation properties such as speed of propagation and segmental contraction duration as observed experimentally. Sensory feedback also restored propagating activity patterns when an inappropriately tuned CPG network failed to generate waves. Finally, in a two-sided CPG model we demonstrated that two types of connectivity could synchronize the activity of two independent networks: connections from excitatory neurons on one side to excitatory contralateral neurons (E to E), and connections from inhibitory neurons on one side to excitatory contralateral neurons (I to E). To our knowledge, such I to E connectivity has not yet been found in any experimental system; however, it provides the most robust mechanism to synchronize activity between contralateral CPGs in our model. Our model provides a general framework for studying the conditions under which a single locally coupled network generates bilaterally synchronized and longitudinally propagating waves in either direction.},

abstract = {The emergence of new and increasingly sophisticated behaviors after birth is accompanied by dramatic increase of newly established synaptic connections in the nervous system. Little is known, however, of how nascent connections are organized to support such new behaviors alongside existing ones. To understand this, in the larval zebrafish we examined the development of spinal pathways from hindbrain V2a neurons and the role of these pathways in the development of locomotion. We found that new projections are continually layered laterally to existing neuropil, and give rise to distinct pathways that function in parallel to existing pathways. Across these chronologically layered pathways, the connectivity patterns and biophysical properties vary systematically to support a behavioral repertoire with a wide range of kinematics and dynamics. Such layering of new parallel circuits equipped with systematically changing properties may be central to the postnatal diversification and increasing sophistication of an animal's behavioral repertoire.Newborn babies have limited abilities. Indeed, most of our actions shortly after birth are the result of reflexes that serve our most basic need: to stay alive. As we get older, however, our behaviour gradually becomes more sophisticated. During this time, the billions of cells in our brain form new connections to build intricate ‘circuits' of neurons that allow for more complicated thoughts and actions.It is clear that the brain circuits that support new behaviours must develop in a way that does not interfere with the existing circuits that are vital for survival. However, the challenge has been to find a way to peer into a brain as it develops to see how these new circuits form.In recent years, zebrafish have revolutionised research into neuronal circuits in animals. Developing over the course of a few days, these small transparent fish provide a window into the brain during the earliest stages of development. Indeed, the circuits of neurons that descend from the brain and connect to the spinal cord have already been mapped in these animals. Now, Pujala and Koyama have begun to follow the careful development of these ‘descending' neurons, and relate it to the appearance of new behaviours in young zebrafish.Time-lapse imaging with a fluorescent protein that is active only in specific descending neurons revealed that new circuits are laid down over existing ones, like the growth rings in a tree. Next, at different timepoints in zebrafish development, Pujala and Koyama traced these neurons backwards from the spine to the brain to identify which connections formed first. This showed that the spinal connections develop one after the other, in the same order that the neurons mature.Next, Pujala and Koyama asked how the activity of neurons that mature early or late in development relates to specific behaviours in young zebrafish. Early-born circuits connect to neurons that produce powerful, reflex-driven, whole-body movements such as an escape response. The later circuits connect to different neurons through slower, less direct pathways; the late-born neurons also generate the refined movements that are acquired later in a zebrafish's development and help the fish to explore its environment.These findings show that descending circuits in zebrafish run parallel to each other, but with distinct connections and properties that allow them to control different kinds of movements. While this study was conducted using an animal model, a better understanding of how such circuits develop and the movements they control may one day aid the treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases or injuries where connections have been lost.},

Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Studying regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) is hampered by current histological and imaging techniques because they provide only partial information about axonal and glial reactions. Here we developed a tetrahydrofuran-based clearing procedure that renders fixed and unsectioned adult CNS tissue transparent and fully penetrable for optical imaging. In large spinal cord segments, we imaged fluorescently labeled cells by 'ultramicroscopy' and two-photon microscopy without the need for histological sectioning. We found that more than a year after injury growth-competent axons regenerated abundantly through the injury site. A few growth-incompetent axons could also regenerate when they bypassed the lesion. Moreover, we accurately determined quantitative changes of glial cells after spinal cord injury. Thus, clearing CNS tissue enables an unambiguous evaluation of axon regeneration and glial reactions. Our clearing procedure also renders other organs transparent, which makes this approach useful for a large number of preclinical paradigms.},

abstract = {Mammalian circadian rhythms are controlled by endogenous biological oscillators, including a master clock located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Since the period of this oscillation is of approximately 24 h, to keep synchrony with the environment, circadian rhythms need to be entrained daily by means of Zeitgeber ("time giver") signals, such as the light-dark cycle. Recent advances in the neurophysiology and molecular biology of circadian rhythmicity allow a better understanding of synchronization. In this review we cover several aspects of the mechanisms for photic entrainment of mammalian circadian rhythms, including retinal sensitivity to light by means of novel photopigments as well as circadian variations in the retina that contribute to the regulation of retinal physiology. Downstream from the retina, we examine retinohypothalamic communication through neurotransmitter (glutamate, aspartate, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide) interaction with SCN receptors and the resulting signal transduction pathways in suprachiasmatic neurons, as well as putative neuron-glia interactions. Finally, we describe and analyze clock gene expression and its importance in entrainment mechanisms, as well as circadian disorders or retinal diseases related to entrainment deficits, including experimental and clinical treatments.},

abstract = {The present study systematically compared the effects of fatigue and alcohol intoxication on a range of neurobehavioural tasks. By doing so, it was possible to quantify the performance impairment associated with fatigue and express it as a blood alcohol impairment equivalent. Twenty-two healthy subjects aged 19-26 years participated in three counterbalanced conditions. In the sustained wakefulness condition, subjects were kept awake for 28 h. In the alcohol and placebo conditions, subjects consumed either an alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage at 30 min intervals, until their blood alcohol concentration reached 0.10{\%}. In each session, performance was measured at hourly intervals using four tasks from a standardised computer-based test battery. Analysis indicated that the placebo beverage did not significantly effect mean relative performance. In contrast, as blood alcohol concentration increased performance on all the tasks, except for one, significantly decreased. Similarly, as hours of wakefulness increased performance levels for four of the six parameters significantly decreased. More importantly, equating the performance impairment in the two conditions indicated that, depending on the task measured, approximately 20-25 h of wakefulness produced performance decrements equivalent to those observed at a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.10{\%}. Overall, these results suggest that moderate levels of fatigue produce performance equivalent to or greater than those observed at levels of alcohol intoxication deemed unacceptable when driving, working and/or operating dangerous equipment.},

abstract = {Persistent mechanical hypersensitivity that occurs in the setting of injury or disease remains a major clinical problem largely because the underlying neural circuitry is still not known. Here we report the functional identification of key components of the elusive dorsal horn circuit for mechanical allodynia. We show that the transient expression of VGLUT3 by a discrete population of neurons in the deep dorsal horn is required for mechanical pain and that activation of the cells in the adult conveys mechanical hypersensitivity. The cells, which receive direct low threshold input, point to a novel location for circuit initiation. Subsequent analysis of c-Fos reveals the circuit extends dorsally to nociceptive lamina I projection neurons, and includes lamina II calretinin neurons, which we show also convey mechanical allodynia. Lastly, using inflammatory and neuropathic pain models, we show that multiple microcircuits in the dorsal horn encode this form of pain. Peirs et al. identified deep dorsal horn neurons that transiently express VGLUT3 and are required for mechanical allodynia. The neurons transmit innocuous input to dorsally directed pain microcircuits that are differentially engaged depending on the type of injury.},

We demonstrate that, in layer 5 of developing mouse visual cortex, preNMDARs specifically control synaptic transmission at pyramidal cell inputs to other pyramidal cells and to Martinotti cells, while leaving those to basket cells unaffected. We also reveal a type of interneuron that mediates ascending inhibition. In agreement with synapse-specific expression, we find preNMDAR-mediated calcium signals in a subset of pyramidal cell terminals. A tuned network model predicts that preNMDARs specifically reroute information flow in local circuits during high-frequency firing, in particular by impacting frequency-dependent disynaptic inhibition mediated by Martinotti cells, a finding that we experimentally verify. We conclude that postsynaptic cell type determines presynaptic terminal molecular identity and that preNMDARs govern information processing in neocortical columns.},

abstract = {The mushroom body in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster is an associative brain centre that translates odour representations into learned behavioural responses. Kenyon cells, the intrinsic neurons of the mushroom body, integrate input from olfactory glomeruli to encode odours as sparse distributed patterns of neural activity. We have developed anatomic tracing techniques to identify the glomerular origin of the inputs that converge onto 200 individual Kenyon cells. Here we show that each Kenyon cell integrates input from a different and apparently random combination of glomeruli. The glomerular inputs to individual Kenyon cells show no discernible organization with respect to their odour tuning, anatomic features or developmental origins. Moreover, different classes of Kenyon cells do not seem to preferentially integrate inputs from specific combinations of glomeruli. This organization of glomerular connections to the mushroom body could allow the fly to contextualize novel sensory experiences, a feature consistent with the role of this brain centre in mediating learned olfactory associations and behaviours.},

abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) are necessary and sufficient for the maintenance of circadian rhythms in primate and other mammalian species. The human dorsomedial SCN contains populations of non-species-specific vasopressin and species-specific neurotensin neurons. We made time-series recordings of core body temperature and locomotor activity in 19 elderly, male, end-stage dementia patients and 8 normal elderly controls. Following the death of the dementia patients, neuropathological diagnostic information and tissue samples from the hypothalamus were obtained. Hypothalamic tissue was also obtained from eight normal control cases that had not had activity or core temperature recordings previously. Core temperature was analysed for parametric, circadian features, and activity was analysed for non-parametric and parametric circadian features. These indices were then correlated with the degree of degeneration seen in the SCN (glia/neuron ratio) and neuronal counts from the dorsomedial SCN (vasopressin, neurotensin). Specific loss of SCN neurotensin neurons was associated with loss of activity and temperature amplitude without increase in activity fragmentation. Loss of SCN vasopressin neurons was associated with increased activity fragmentation but not loss of amplitude. Evidence for a circadian rhythm of vasopressinergic activity was seen in the dementia cases but no evidence was seen for a circadian rhythm in neurotensinergic activity. These results provide evidence that the SCN is necessary for the maintenance of the circadian rhythm in humans, information on the role of neuronal subpopulations in subserving this function and the utility of dementia in elaborating brain-behaviour relationships in the human.},

We studied experience-dependent plasticity in the barrel cortex of mice carrying a point mutation of the alpha-CaMKII gene (T286A), which abolishes this enzyme's ability to autophosphorylate. Plasticity was prevented in adult and adolescent mice homozygous for the mutation, but was normal in heterozygotes and wild-type littermates.

abstract = {The responses of vertebrate neurones to glutamate involve at least three receptor types. One of these, the NMDA receptor (so called because of its specific activation by N-methyl-D-aspartate), induces responses presenting a peculiar voltage sensitivity. Above resting potential, the current induced by a given dose of glutamate (or NMDA) increases when the cell is depolarized. This is contrary to what is observed at classical excitatory synapses, and recalls the properties of 'regenerative' systems like the Na+ conductance of the action potential. Indeed, recent studies of L-glutamate, L-aspartate and NMDA-induced currents have indicated that the current-voltage (I-V) relationship can show a region of 'negative conductance' and that the application of these agonists can lead to a regenerative depolarization. Furthermore, the NMDA response is greatly potentiated by reducing the extracellular Mg2+ concentration [( Mg2+]o) below the physiological level (approximately 1 mM). By analysing the responses of mouse central neurones to glutamate using the patch-clamp technique, we have now found a link between voltage sensitivity and Mg2+ sensitivity. In Mg2+-free solutions, L-glutamate, L-aspartate and NMDA open cation channels, the properties of which are voltage independent. In the presence of Mg2+, the single-channel currents measured at resting potential are chopped in bursts and the probability of opening of the channels is reduced. Both effects increase steeply with hyperpolarization, thereby accounting for the negative slope of the I-V relationship of the glutamate response. Thus, the voltage dependence of the NMDA receptor-linked conductance appears to be a consequence of the voltage dependence of the Mg2+ block and its interpretation does not require the implication of an intramembrane voltage-dependent 'gate'.},

abstract = {Neuromodulation can dynamically alter neuronal and synaptic properties, thereby changing the behavioral output of a neural circuit. It is therefore conceivable that natural selection might act upon neuromodulation as a mechanism for sculpting the behavioral repertoire of a species. Here we report that the presence of neuromodulation is correlated with the production of a behavior that most likely evolved independently in two species: Tritonia diomedea and Pleurobranchaea californica (Mollusca, Gastropoda, Opisthobranchia, Nudipleura). Individuals of both species exhibit escape swimming behaviors consisting of repeated dorsal-ventral whole-body flexions. The central pattern generator (CPG) circuits underlying these behaviors contain homologous identified neurons: DSI and C2 in Tritonia and As and A1 in Pleurobranchaea. Homologs of these neurons also can be found in Hermissenda crassicornis where they are named CPT and C2, respectively. However, members of this species do not exhibit an analogous swimming behavior. In Tritonia and Pleurobranchaea, but not in Hermissenda, the serotonergic DSI homologs modulated the strength of synapses made by C2 homologs. Furthermore, the serotonin receptor antagonist methysergide blocked this neuromodulation and the swimming behavior. Additionally, in Pleurobranchaea, the robustness of swimming correlated with the extent of the synaptic modulation. Finally, injection of serotonin induced the swimming behavior in Tritonia and Pleurobranchaea, but not in Hermissenda. This suggests that the analogous swimming behaviors of Tritonia and Pleurobranchaea share a common dependence on serotonergic neuromodulation. Thus, neuromodulation may provide a mechanism that enables species to acquire analogous behaviors independently using homologous neural circuit components.},

We demonstrate that, in layer 5 of developing mouse visual cortex, preNMDARs specifically control synaptic transmission at pyramidal cell inputs to other pyramidal cells and to Martinotti cells, while leaving those to basket cells unaffected. We also reveal a type of interneuron that mediates ascending inhibition. In agreement with synapse-specific expression, we find preNMDAR-mediated calcium signals in a subset of pyramidal cell terminals. A tuned network model predicts that preNMDARs specifically reroute information flow in local circuits during high-frequency firing, in particular by impacting frequency-dependent disynaptic inhibition mediated by Martinotti cells, a finding that we experimentally verify. We conclude that postsynaptic cell type determines presynaptic terminal molecular identity and that preNMDARs govern information processing in neocortical columns.},

abstract = {At a synapse, fast synchronous neurotransmitter release requires localization of Ca(2+) channels to presynaptic active zones. How Ca(2+) channels are recruited to active zones, however, remains unknown. Using unbiased yeast two-hybrid screens, we here identify a direct interaction of the central PDZ domain of the active-zone protein RIM with the C termini of presynaptic N- and P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels but not L-type Ca(2+) channels. To test the physiological significance of this interaction, we generated conditional knockout mice lacking all multidomain RIM isoforms. Deletion of RIM proteins ablated most neurotransmitter release by simultaneously impairing the priming of synaptic vesicles and by decreasing the presynaptic localization of Ca(2+) channels. Strikingly, rescue of the decreased Ca(2+)-channel localization required the RIM PDZ domain, whereas rescue of vesicle priming required the RIM N terminus. We propose that RIMs tether N- and P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels to presynaptic active zones via a direct PDZ-domain-mediated interaction, thereby enabling fast, synchronous triggering of neurotransmitter release at a synapse.},

abstract = {Interindividual differences in neuronal wiring may contribute to behavioral individuality and affect susceptibility to neurological disorders. To investigate the causes and potential consequences of wiring variation in Drosophila melanogaster, we focused on a hemilineage of ventral nerve cord interneurons that exhibits morphological variability. We find that late-born subclasses of the 12A hemilineage are highly sensitive to genetic and environmental variation. Neurons in the second thoracic segment are particularly variable with regard to two developmental decisions, whereas its segmental homologs are more robust. This variability "hotspot" depends on Ultrabithorax expression in the 12A neurons, indicating variability is cell-intrinsic and under genetic control. 12A development is more variable and sensitive to temperature in long-established laboratory strains than in strains recently derived from the wild. Strains with a high frequency of one of the 12A variants also showed a high frequency of animals with delayed spontaneous flight initiation, whereas other wing-related behaviors did not show such a correlation and were thus not overtly affected by 12A variation. These results show that neurodevelopmental robustness is variable and under genetic control in Drosophila and suggest that the fly may serve as a model for identifying conserved gene pathways that stabilize wiring in stressful developmental environments. Moreover, some neuronal lineages are variation hotspots and thus may be more amenable to evolutionary change.},

abstract = {Persistent mechanical hypersensitivity that occurs in the setting of injury or disease remains a major clinical problem largely because the underlying neural circuitry is still not known. Here we report the functional identification of key components of the elusive dorsal horn circuit for mechanical allodynia. We show that the transient expression of VGLUT3 by a discrete population of neurons in the deep dorsal horn is required for mechanical pain and that activation of the cells in the adult conveys mechanical hypersensitivity. The cells, which receive direct low threshold input, point to a novel location for circuit initiation. Subsequent analysis of c-Fos reveals the circuit extends dorsally to nociceptive lamina I projection neurons, and includes lamina II calretinin neurons, which we show also convey mechanical allodynia. Lastly, using inflammatory and neuropathic pain models, we show that multiple microcircuits in the dorsal horn encode this form of pain. Peirs et al. identified deep dorsal horn neurons that transiently express VGLUT3 and are required for mechanical allodynia. The neurons transmit innocuous input to dorsally directed pain microcircuits that are differentially engaged depending on the type of injury.},

abstract = {The sense of smell enables animals to react to long-distance cues according to learned and innate valences. Here, we have mapped with electron microscopy the complete wiring diagram of the Drosophila larval antennal lobe, an olfactory neuropil similar to the vertebrate olfactory bulb. We found a canonical circuit with uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs) relaying gain-controlled ORN activity to the mushroom body and the lateral horn. A second, parallel circuit with multiglomerular projection neurons (mPNs) and hierarchically connected local neurons (LNs) selectively integrates multiple ORN signals already at the first synapse. LN-LN synaptic connections putatively implement a bistable gain control mechanism that either computes odor saliency through panglomerular inhibition, or allows some glomeruli to respond to faint aversive odors in the presence of strong appetitive odors. This complete wiring diagram will support experimental and theoretical studies towards bridging the gap between circuits and behavior.Our sense of smell can tell us about bread being baked faraway in the kitchen, or whether a leftover piece finally went bad. Similarly to the eyes, the nose enables us to make up a mental image of what lies at a distance. In mammals, the surface of the nose hosts a huge number of olfactory sensory cells, each of which is tuned to respond to a small set of scent molecules. The olfactory sensory cells communicate with a region of the brain called the olfactory bulb. Olfactory sensory cells of the same type converge onto the same small pocket of the olfactory bulb, forming a structure called a glomerulus. Similarly to how the retina generates an image, the combined activity of multiple glomeruli defines an odor.A particular smell is the combination of many volatile compounds, the odorants. Therefore the interactions between different olfactory glomeruli are important for defining the nature of the perceived odor. Although the types of neurons involved in these interactions were known in insects, fish and mice, a precise wiring diagram of a complete set of glomeruli had not been described. In particular, the points of contact through which neurons communicate with each other – known as synapses – among all the neurons participating in an olfactory system were not known.Berck, Khandelwal et al. have now taken advantage of the small size of the olfactory system of the larvae of Drosophila fruit flies to fully describe, using high-resolution imaging, all its neurons and their synapses. The results define the complete wiring diagram of the neural circuit that processes the signals sent by olfactory sensory neurons in the larva's olfactory circuits.In addition to the neurons that read out the activity of a single glomerulus and send it to higher areas of the brain for further processing, there are also numerous neurons that read out activity from multiple glomeruli. These neurons represent a system, encoded in the genome, for quickly extracting valuable olfactory information and then relaying it to other areas of the brain.An essential aspect of sensation is the ability to stop noticing a stimulus if it doesn't change. This allows an animal to, for example, find food by moving in a direction that increases the intensity of an odor. Inhibition mediates some aspects of this capability. The discovery of structure in the inhibitory connections among glomeruli, together with prior findings on the inner workings of the olfactory system, enabled Berck, Khandelwal et al. to hypothesize how the olfactory circuits enable odor gradients to be navigated. Further investigation revealed more about how the circuits could detect slight changes in odor concentration regardless of whether the overall odor intensity is strong or faint. And, crucially, it revealed how the worst odors – which can signal danger – can still be perceived in the presence of very strong pleasant odors.With the wiring diagram, theories about the sense of smell can now be tested using the genetic tools available for Drosophila, leading to an understanding of how neural circuits work.},

Our microfluidics-based approach described here is one of the first to facilitate rapid orientation for end-on imaging, and it is a major breakthrough for quantitative studies on Drosophila embryogenesis. The operating principle of the embryo trap is based on passive hydrodynamics, and it does not require direct manipulation of embryos by the user; biologists following the protocol should be able to repeat these procedures. The compact design and fabrication materials used allow the device to be used with traditional microscopy setups and do not require specialized fixtures.

@article{Rittenhouse1999,
abstract = {Brief monocular deprivation during early postnatal development can lead to a depression of synaptic transmission that renders visual cortical neurons unresponsive to subsequent visual stimulation through the deprived eye. The Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) theory proposes that homosynaptic mechanisms of long-term depression (LTD) account for the deprivation effects. Homosynaptic depression, by definition, occurs only at active synapses. Thus, in contrast to the commonly held view that the synaptic depression caused by monocular deprivation is simply a result of retinal inactivity, this theoretical framework indicates that the synaptic depression may actually be driven by the residual activity in the visually deprived retina. Here we examine the validity of this idea by comparing the consequences of brief monocular deprivation by lid suture with those of monocular inactivation by intra-ocular treatment with tetrodotoxin. Lid suture leaves the retina spontaneously active, whereas tetrodotoxin eliminates all activity. In agreement with the BCM theory, our results show that monocular lid suture causes a significantly greater depression of deprived-eye responses in kitten visual cortex than does treatment with tetrodotoxin. These findings have important implications for mechanisms of experience-dependent plasticity in the neocortex.},

To address this question, we repeatedly imaged individual pyramidal neurons in the mouse barrel cortex over periods of weeks. We found that, although dendritic structure is stable, some spines appear and disappear. Spine lifetimes vary greatly: stable spines, about 50{\%} of the population, persist for at least a month, whereas the remainder are present for a few days or less. Serial-section electron microscopy of imaged dendritic segments revealed retrospectively that spine sprouting and retraction are associated with synapse formation and elimination. Experience-dependent plasticity of cortical receptive fields was accompanied by increased synapse turnover. Our measurements suggest that sensory experience drives the formation and elimination of synapses and that these changes might underlie adaptive remodelling of neural circuits.},

abstract = {The dorsal horn of the spinal cord consists of distinct laminae that serve as a pivotal region for relaying a variety of somatosensory signals such as temperature, pain, and touch. The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of the dorsal horn are poorly understood. To define a molecular map of the dorsal horn circuit, we have profiled dorsal horn-enriched (DHE) gene expression in dorsal spinal cords on embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) by genome-wide microarray and smart subtractive screening based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). High-throughput in situ hybridization (ISH) was carried out to validate the expression of 379 genes in the developing dorsal spinal cord. A total of 113 DHE genes were identified, of which 59{\%} show lamina-specific expression patterns. Most lamina-specific genes were expressed across at least two laminae, however. About 32{\%} of all DHE genes are transcription factors, which represent the largest percentage of the group of all DHE functional classifications. Importantly, several individual lamina-specific transcription factors such c-Maf, Rora, and Satb1 are identified for the first time. Epistasis studies revealed several putative effectors of known DHE transcription factors such as Drg11, Tlx3(Rnx), and Lmx1b. These effector genes, including Grp, Trpc3, Pcp4, and Enc1, have been implicated in synaptic transmission, calcium homeostasis, and structural function and thus may have similar roles in the dorsal horn. The identification of a large number of DHE genes, especially those that are lamina specific, lays a foundation for future studies on the molecular machinery that controls the development of the dorsal horn and on functional differences of these distinct laminae in the dorsal spinal cord. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

RGCs stimulated out of synchrony rapidly lost the ability to drive tectal postsynaptic partners while their axons grew and added many new branches. In contrast, synchronously activated RGCs produced fewer new branches, but these were more stable. The effects of synchronous activation were prevented by the inhibition of neurotransmitter release and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade, which is consistent with a role for synaptic NMDAR activation in the stabilization of axonal branches and suppression of further exploratory branch addition.},

abstract = {When placed on a temperature gradient, a Drosophila larva navigates away from excessive cold or heat by regulating the size, frequency, and direction of reorientation maneuvers between successive periods of forward movement. Forward movement is driven by peristalsis waves that travel from tail to head. During each reorientation maneuver, the larva pauses and sweeps its head from side to side until it picks a new direction for forward movement. Here, we characterized the motor programs that underlie the initiation, execution, and completion of reorientation maneuvers by measuring body segment dynamics of freely moving larvae with fluorescent muscle fibers as they were exposed to temporal changes in temperature. We find that reorientation maneuvers are characterized by highly stereotyped spatiotemporal patterns of segment dynamics. Reorientation maneuvers are initiated with head sweeping movement driven by asymmetric contraction of a portion of anterior body segments. The larva attains a new direction for forward movement after head sweeping movement by using peristalsis waves that gradually push posterior body segments out of alignment with the tail (i.e., the previous direction of forward movement) into alignment with the head. Thus, reorientation maneuvers during thermotaxis are carried out by two alternating motor programs: (1) peristalsis for driving forward movement and (2) asymmetric contraction of anterior body segments for driving head sweeping movement.},

Here, we review the current status of its various applications in plants, where it is used for the successful generation of stable mutations in a steadily growing number of species through NHEJ. Furthermore, tremendous progress in plant genome engineering by HR was obtained by the setup of replicon mediated and in planta gene targeting techniques. Finally, other complex approaches that rely on the induction of more than one DNA lesion at a time such as paired nickases to avoid off-site effects or controlled genomic deletions are beginning to be applied routinely.},

abstract = {Cyclic AMP is an intracellular mediator ('second messenger') in the nervous and endocrine control of cellular function, regulating different processes in different cell types. Although evidence is incomplete, it seems that cyclic AMP enhances the calcium-mediated release of neurotransmitter in some neurones. A simple form of memory in the mollusc Aplysia is probably encoded as a cyclic AMP-induced enhancement of neurotransmission at certain synapses of the central nervous system. The possibility that cyclic AMP participates in learning mechanisms may be explored using genetic mutants. For this purpose the fruitfly Drosophila is suitable as it is genetically well characterized and can learn through olfaction, vision or taste. We show here that independent searches for mutations of olfactory learning and of cyclic AMP metabolism, and for mutations causing female infertility have each led to the same gene--the dunce gene. Our evidence indicates that the normal dunce gene may specify a cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase.},

abstract = {Injection of formalin in the rat hindpaw produces two phases of nociceptive behavior. Although it is generally agreed that the first phase results from direct chemical activation of nociceptive primary afferent fibers, the factors that contribute to the second phase are not established. In the present study, we monitored the expression of the c-fos protein to evaluate whether the pattern of activity of dorsal horn neurons differs as a result of ongoing afferent activity during the two phases. To selectively block the first or second phase, we respectively used remifentanil, a potent and short acting opiate agonist, and QX-314, a quaternary derivative of lidocaine, which does not cross the blood brain barrier. We also evaluated the effect of eliminating nociceptive behavior in both phases using both remifentanil and lidocaine or a combination of local anesthetics, bupivicaine and quaternary lidocaine. In all groups, formalin (5{\%}, 50 ??l) was injected subcutaneously into the plantar surface of the hindpaw. To assess the nociceptive behavior produced by formalin, we monitored the number of flinches. Injection of remifentanil during the first phase completely blocked the first phase formalin-evoked nociceptive behavior, and had no effect on the second phase. Injection of lidocaine during the interphase completely blocked second phase nociceptive behavior. As expected, when remifentanil was administered during the first phase and lidocaine during the second phase, all formalin-evoked nociceptive behavior was blocked. The same was true for rats that received injections of bupivicaine and lidocaine during phases 1 and 2, respectively. In laminae I-II of the L4-L5 segment, the magnitude of the decrease in Fos expression was comparable for remifentanil (26.5{\%}) and lidocaine (27.3{\%}); the decrease was greater when both remifentanil and lidocaine were administered (50.5{\%}), and even greater when bupivicaine and lidocaine were used (74.2{\%}). In laminae V-VI, remifentanil, by itself, decreased c-fos expression by 39.4{\%}; for lidocaine alone, the decrease was 58.4{\%}. We did not observe further significant decreases when both remifentanil and lidocaine, or bupivacaine and lidocaine were injected (69.7{\%} and 74.6{\%}, respectively). Our results not only provide strong evidence that activity during the second phase is necessary for maintaining the maximal expression of c-fos in the spinal cord, but also reveal significant regional differences in the central patterns of activity generated during the two phases. These results also confirm our previous reports that c-fos expression is not eliminated when the behavioral manifestation of the noxious stimulus is completely blocked.},

We screened the mice with a limbic MR deficiency in various learning and exploration tests. The mutant mice show impaired learning of the water-maze task and deficits in measures of working memory on the radial maze due to behavioral perseverance and stereotypy. They exhibit a hyperreactivity toward a novel object but normal anxiety-like behavior. The behavioral changes are associated with abnormalities of the mossy fiber projection and an up-regulation of GR expression in the hippocampus. Adult mutant mice show normal corticosterone levels at circadian trough and peak. This genetic model provides important information about the consequences of a permanently altered balance between limbic MR and GR, with implications for stress-related neuroendocrine and neuropsychiatric diseases.},

abstract = {The mechanism whereby brief light exposure resets the mammalian circadian clock in a phase dependent manner is not known, but is thought to involve Per gene expression. At the behavioural level, a light pulse produces phase delays in early subjective night, phase advances in late subjective night, and no phase shifts in mid-subjective night or subjective day. To understand the relationship between Per gene activity and behavioural phase shifts, we examined light-induced mPer1 and mPer2 expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mouse, in the subjective night, with a view to understanding SCN heterogeneity. In the VIP-containing region of the SCN (termed 'core'), light-induced mPer1 expression occurs at all times of the subjective night, while mPer2 induction is seen only in early subjective night. In the remaining regions of the SCN (termed 'shell'), a phase delaying light pulse produces no mPer1 but significant mPer2 expression, while a phase advancing light pulse produces no mPer2 but substantial mPer1 induction. Moreover, following a light pulse during mid-subjective night, neither mPer1 nor mPer2 are induced in the shell. The results reveal that behavioural phase shifts occur only when light-induced Per gene expression spreads from the core to the shell SCN, with mPer1 expression in shell corresponding to phase advances, and mPer2 corresponding to phase delays. The results indicate that the time course and the localization of light-induced Per gene expression in SCN reveals important aspects of intra-SCN communication.},

abstract = {Objective: Using salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and actigraphy, our study sought to determine if Parkinson disease (PD) patients demonstrate circadian disturbance compared to healthy controls. Additionally, our study investigated if circadian disturbances represent a disease-related process or may be attributed to dopaminergic therapy. Methods: Twenty-nine patients with PD were divided into unmedicated and medicated groups and were compared to 27 healthy controls. All participants underwent neurologic assessment and 14. days of actigraphy to establish habitual sleep-onset time (HSO). DLMO time and area under the melatonin curve (AUC) were calculated from salivary melatonin sampling. The phase angle of entrainment was calculated by subtracting DLMO from HSO. Overnight polysomnography (PSG) was performed to determine sleep architecture. Results: DLMO and HSO were not different across the groups. However, the phase angle of entrainment was more than twice as long in the medicated PD group compared to the unmedicated PD group (U=35.5; P=002) and was more than 50{\%} longer than controls (U=130.0; P=021). The medicated PD group showed more than double the melatonin AUC compared to the unmedicated group (U=31; P=0.001) and controls (U=87; P=.001). There was no difference in these measures comparing unmedicated PD and controls. Conclusions: In PD dopaminergic treatment profoundly increases the secretion of melatonin. Our study reported no difference in circadian phase and HSO between groups. However, PD patients treated with dopaminergic therapy unexpectedly showed a delayed sleep onset relative to DLMO, suggesting dopaminergic therapy in PD results in an uncoupling of circadian and sleep regulation. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Sleep disruption is a commonly encountered clinical feature in schizophrenic patients, and one important concern is to determine the extent of this disruption under "real" life situations. Simultaneous wrist actigraphy, diary records, and repeated urine collection for urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) profiles are appropriate tools to assess circadian rhythms and sleep patterns in field studies. Their suitability for long-term recordings of schizophrenic patients living in the community has not been evaluated. In this case report, we document long-term simultaneous wrist actigraphy, light detection, repeated urine collection, and diary records as a suitable combination of non-invasive techniques to quantify and assess changes in sleep-wake cycles, light exposure, and melatonin profiles in a schizophrenic patient. The actigraph was well-tolerated by the patient, and compliance to diary records and 48 h urine collection was particularly good with assistance from family members. The data obtained by these techniques are illustrated, and the results reveal remarkable abnormal patterns of rest-activity patterns, light exposure, and melatonin production. We observed various rest-activity patterns, including phase-shifts, highly delayed sleep on- and offsets, and irregular rest-activity phases. The period of the rest-activity rhythm, light-dark cycle, and melatonin rhythm was longer than 24 h. These circadian abnormalities may reinforce the altered sleep patterns and the problems of cognitive function and social engagement associated with schizophrenic.},

abstract = {Decades of research on the neural code underlying spatial navigation have revealed a diverse set of neural response properties. The Entorhinal Cortex (EC) of the mammalian brain contains a rich set of spatial correlates, including grid cells which encode space using tessellating patterns. However, the mechanisms and functional significance of these spatial representations remain largely mysterious. As a new way to understand these neural representations, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform navigation tasks in 2D arenas based on velocity inputs. Surprisingly, we find that grid-like spatial response patterns emerge in trained networks, along with units that exhibit other spatial correlates, including border cells and band-like cells. All these different functional types of neurons have been observed experimentally. The order of the emergence of grid-like and border cells is also consistent with observations from developmental studies. Together, our results suggest that grid cells, border cells and others as observed in EC may be a natural solution for representing space efficiently given the predominant recurrent connections in the neural circuits.},

abstract = {The functional networks of cultured neurons exhibit complex network properties similar to those found in vivo. Starting from random seeding, cultures undergo significant reorganization during the initial period in vitro, yet despite providing an ideal platform for observing developmental changes in neuronal connectivity, little is known about how a complex functional network evolves from isolated neurons. In the present study, evolution of functional connectivity was estimated from correlations of spontaneous activity. Network properties were quantified using complex measures from graph theory and used to compare cultures at different stages of development during the first 5 weeks in vitro. Networks obtained from young cultures (14 days in vitro) exhibited a random topology, which evolved to a small-world topology during maturation. The topology change was accompanied by an increased presence of highly connected areas (hubs) and network efficiency increased with age. The small-world topology balances integration of network areas with segregation of specialized processing units. The emergence of such network structure in cultured neurons, despite a lack of external input, points to complex intrinsic biological mechanisms. Moreover, the functional network of cultures at mature ages is efficient and highly suited to complex processing tasks.},

abstract = {Ion channels formed by the TRP (transient receptor potential) superfamily of proteins act as sensors for temperature, osmolarity, mechanical stress and taste. The growth cones of developing axons are responsible for sensing extracellular guidance factors, many of which trigger Ca2+ influx at the growth cone; however, the identity of the ion channels involved remains to be clarified. Here, we report that TRP-like channel activity exists in the growth cones of cultured Xenopus neurons and can be modulated by exposure to netrin-1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, two chemoattractants for axon guidance. Whole-cell recording from growth cones showed that netrin-1 induced a membrane depolarization, part of which remained after all major voltage-dependent channels were blocked. Furthermore, the membrane depolarization was sensitive to blockers of TRP channels. Pharmacological blockade of putative TRP currents or downregulation of Xenopus TRP-1 (xTRPC1) expression with a specific morpholino oligonucleotide abolished the growth-cone turning and Ca2+ elevation induced by a netrin-1 gradient. Thus, TRPC currents reflect early events in the growth cone's detection of some extracellular guidance signals, resulting in membrane depolarization and cytoplasmic Ca2+ elevation that mediates the turning of growth cones.},

The spin-diffusion equation is formed from first principles by assuming nearest neighbor interactions for a molecule undergoing isotropic random reorientation. This equation describes diffusion only in the long correlation limit (for ($\omega$$\tau$c {\textgreater} 1.118) and is solved for driven NOE experiments, for spins in a chain of infinite length (0 {\textless} × {\textless} ∞), or for spins in a chain of finite length (0 {\textless} × {\textless} L). The solutions are obtained using the method of the Laplace transform for specified initial and boundary conditions. The observed selectivity of the NOE transfer in driven NOE experiments on a biomolecule which has a correlation factor $\omega$$\tau$c ∼ 3 is indeed in conformity with the predictions obtained from the spin-diffusion equation. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Although microglia have been implicated in nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain, the manner by which injured sensory neurons engage microglia remains unclear. We found that peripheral nerve injury induced de novo expression of colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) in injured sensory neurons. CSF1 was transported to the spinal cord, where it targeted the microglial CSF1 receptor (CSF1R). Cre-mediated sensory neuron deletion of Csf1 completely prevented nerve injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and reduced microglial activation and proliferation. In contrast, intrathecal injection of CSF1 induced mechanical hypersensitivity and microglial proliferation. Nerve injury also upregulated CSF1 in motoneurons, where it was required for ventral horn microglial activation and proliferation. Downstream of CSF1R, we found that the microglial membrane adaptor protein DAP12 was required for both nerve injury- and intrathecal CSF1-induced upregulation of pain-related microglial genes and the ensuing pain, but not for microglial proliferation. Thus, both CSF1 and DAP12 are potential targets for the pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain.},

Today BMIs designed for both experimental and clinical studies can translate raw neuronal signals into motor commands that reproduce arm reaching and hand grasping movements in artificial actuators. Clearly, these developments hold promise for the restoration of limb mobility in paralyzed subjects. However, as we review here, before this goal can be reached several bottlenecks have to be passed. These include designing a fully implantable biocompatible recording device, further developing real-time computational algorithms, introducing a method for providing the brain with sensory feedback from the actuators, and designing and building artificial prostheses that can be controlled directly by brain-derived signals. By reaching these milestones, future BMIs will be able to drive and control revolutionary prostheses that feel and act like the human arm. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) is an enhancement of synaptic strength that can be produced by pairing of presynaptic activity with postsynaptic depolarization. LTP in the hippocampus has been extensively studied as a cellular model of learning and memory, but the nature of the underlying synaptic modification remains elusive, partly because our knowledge of central synapses is still limited. One proposal is that the modification is postsynaptic, and that synapses expressing only NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors before potentiation are induced by LTP to express functional AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionate) receptors. Here we report that a high proportion of synapses in hippocampal area CA1 transmit with NMDA receptors but not AMPA receptors, making these synapses effectively non-functional at normal resting potentials. These silent synapses acquire AMPA-type responses following LTP induction. Our findings challenge the view that LTP in CA1 involves a presynaptic modification, and suggest instead a simple postsynaptic mechanism for both induction and expression of LTP.},

Recently, familial EA has been linked to the voltage-dependent delayed rectifier, Kv1.1, on chromosome 12. Six EA families have been identified that carry distinct Kv1.1 missense mutations; all individuals are heterozygous. Expression in Xenopus oocytes demonstrates that two of the EA subunits form homomeric channels with altered gating properties. V408A channels have voltage dependence similar to that of wild-type channels, but with faster kinetics and increased C-type inactivation, while the voltage dependence of F184C channels is shifted 20 mV positive. The other four EA subunits do not produce functional homomeric channels but reduce the potassium current when coassembled with wild-type subunits. The results suggest a cellular mechanism underlying EA in which the affected nerve cells cannot efficiently repolarize following an action potential because of altered delayed rectifier function.},

Recent in vitro experiments have revealed that both LTP and long-term depression (LTD) can arise by appropriately pairing weak synaptic inputs with action potentials in the postsynaptic cell. This discovery has generated new insights into the conditions under which synaptic modification may occur in pyramidal neurons in vivo. First, it has been shown that the temporal order of the synaptic input and the postsynaptic spike within a narrow temporal window determines whether LTP or LTD is elicited, according to a temporally asymmetric Hebbian learning rule. Second, backpropagating action potentials are able to serve as a global signal for synaptic plasticity in a neuron compared with local associative interactions between synaptic inputs on dendrites. Third, a specific temporal pattern of activity - postsynaptic bursting - accompanies synaptic potentiation in adults.},

abstract = {Animals rely on the relative timing of events in their environment to form and update predictive associations, but the molecular and circuit mechanisms for this temporal sensitivity remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that olfactory associations in Drosophila can be written and reversed on a trial-by-trial basis depending on the temporal relationship between an odor cue and dopaminergic reinforcement. Through the synchronous recording of neural activity and behavior, we show that reversals in learned odor attraction correlate with bidirectional neural plasticity in the mushroom body, the associative olfactory center of the fly. Two dopamine receptors, DopR1 and DopR2, contribute to this temporal sensitivity by coupling to distinct second messengers and directing either synaptic depression or potentiation. Our results reveal how dopamine-receptor signaling pathways can detect the order of events to instruct opposing forms of synaptic and behavioral plasticity, allowing animals to flexibly update their associations in a dynamic environment. Olfactory associations are formed and updated on a trial-by-trial basis depending on the timing of the odor presentation and reinforcement mediated by two dopamine receptor signaling pathways that play opposing roles in directing synaptic and behavioral plasticity in Drosophila.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The tumor suppressor p53, one of the most intensely investigated proteins, is usually studied by experiments that are averaged over cell populations, potentially masking the dynamic behavior in individual cells. We present a system for following, in individual living cells, the dynamics of p53 and its negative regulator Mdm2 (refs. 1,4-7): this system uses functional p53-CFP and Mdm2-YFP fusion proteins and time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. We found that p53 was expressed in a series of discrete pulses after DNA damage. Genetically identical cells had different numbers of pulses: zero, one, two or more. The mean height and duration of each pulse were fixed and did not depend on the amount of DNA damage. The mean number of pulses, however, increased with DNA damage. This approach can be used to study other signaling systems and suggests that the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop generates a 'digital' clock that releases well-timed quanta of p53 until damage is repaired or the cell dies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although evolutionary models of cooperation build on the intuition that costs of the donor and benefits to the receiver are the most general fundamental parameters, it is largely unknown how they affect the decision of animals to cooperate with an unrelated social partner. Here we test experimentally whether costs to the donor and need of the receiver decide about the amount of help provided by unrelated rats in an iterated prisoner's dilemma game.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Fourteen unrelated Norway rats were alternately presented to a cooperative or defective partner for whom they could provide food via a mechanical apparatus. Direct costs for this task and the need of the receiver were manipulated in two separate experiments. Rats provided more food to cooperative partners than to defectors (direct reciprocity). The propensity to discriminate between helpful and non-helpful social partners was contingent on costs: An experimentally increased resistance in one Newton steps to pull food for the social partner reduced the help provided to defectors more strongly than the help returned to cooperators. Furthermore, test rats provided more help to hungry receivers that were light or in poor condition, which might suggest empathy, whereas this relationship was inverse when experimental partners were satiated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In a prisoner's dilemma situation rats seem to take effect of own costs and potential benefits to a receiver when deciding about helping a social partner, which confirms the predictions of reciprocal cooperation. Thus, factors that had been believed to be largely confined to human social behaviour apparently influence the behaviour of other social animals as well, despite widespread scepticism. Therefore our results shed new light on the biological basis of reciprocity.},

abstract = {In an attempt to improve behavioral memory, we devised a strategy to amplify the signal-to-noise ratio of the cAMP pathway, which plays a central role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and behavioral memory. Multiple high-frequency trains of electrical stimulation induce long-lasting long-term potentiation, a form of synaptic strengthening in hippocampus that is greater in both magnitude and persistence than the short-lasting long-term potentiation generated by a single tetanic train. Studies using pharmacological inhibitors and genetic manipulations have shown that this difference in response depends on the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Genetic studies have also indicated that protein kinase A and one of its target transcription factors, cAMP response element binding protein, are important in memory in vivo. These findings suggested that amplification of signals through the cAMP pathway might lower the threshold for generating long-lasting long-term potentiation and increase behavioral memory. We therefore examined the biochemical, physiological, and behavioral effects in mice of partial inhibition of a hippocampal cAMP phosphodiesterase. Concentrations of a type IV-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, rolipram, which had no significant effect on basal cAMP concentration, increased the cAMP response of hippocampal slices to stimulation with forskolin and induced persistent long-term potentiation in CA1 after a single tetanic train. In both young and aged mice, rolipram treatment before training increased long- but not short-term retention in freezing to context, a hippocampus-dependent memory task.},

abstract = {Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a Hebbian learning rule important for synaptic refinement during development and for learning and memory in the adult. Given the importance of the hippocampus in memory, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms and functions of hippocampal STDP. In the present work, we investigated the requirements for induction of hippocampal spike timing-dependent long-term potentiation (t-LTP) and spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) and the mechanisms of these 2 forms of plasticity at CA3-CA1 synapses in young (P12-P18) mouse hippocampus. We found that both t-LTP and t-LTD can be induced at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses by pairing presynaptic activity with single postsynaptic action potentials at low stimulation frequency (0.2 Hz). Both t-LTP and t-LTD require NMDA-type glutamate receptors for their induction, but the location and properties of these receptors are different: While t-LTP requires postsynaptic ionotropic NMDA receptor function, t-LTD does not, and whereas t-LTP is blocked by antagonists at GluN2A and GluN2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors, t-LTD is blocked by GluN2C or GluN2D subunit-preferring NMDA receptor antagonists. Both t-LTP and t-LTD require postsynaptic Ca(2+) for their induction. Induction of t-LTD also requires metabotropic glutamate receptor activation, phospholipase C activation, postsynaptic IP3 receptor-mediated Ca(2+) release from internal stores, postsynaptic endocannabinoid (eCB) synthesis, activation of CB1 receptors and astrocytic signaling, possibly via release of the gliotransmitter d-serine. We furthermore found that presynaptic calcineurin is required for t-LTD induction. t-LTD is expressed presynaptically as indicated by fluctuation analysis, paired-pulse ratio, and rate of use-dependent depression of postsynaptic NMDA receptor currents by MK801. The results show that CA3-CA1 synapses display both NMDA receptor-dependent t-LTP and t-LTD during development and identify a presynaptic form of hippocampal t-LTD similar to that previously described at neocortical synapses during development.},

Drosophila larvae show an effective motor program to navigate away from light sources. How the larval visual circuit processes light stimuli to control navigational decision remains unknown. The larval visual system is composed of two sensory input channels, Rhodopsin5 (Rh5) and Rhodopsin6 (Rh6) expressing photoreceptors (PRs). We here characterize how spatial and temporal information are used to control navigation. Rh6-PRs are required to perceive temporal changes of light intensity during head casts, while Rh5-PRs are required to control behaviors that allow navigation in response to spatial cues. We characterize how distinct behaviors are modulated and identify parallel acting and converging features of the visual circuit. Functional features of the larval visual circuit highlight the principle of how early in a sensory circuit distinct behaviors may be computed by partly overlapping sensory pathways.},

However, the cellular and circuit mechanisms whereby ILPs regulate learning remain largely unknown. Here, we characterize two ILPs that play antagonistic roles in aversive olfactory learning of C. elegans. We show that the ILP ins-6 acts from ASI sensory neurons to enable learning by repressing the transcription of another ILP, ins-7, specifically in URX neurons. A high level of INS-7 from URX disrupts learning by antagonizing the insulin receptor-like homolog DAF-2 in the postsynaptic neurons RIA, which play an essential role in the neural circuit underlying olfactory learning. We also show that increasing URX-generated INS-7 and loss of INS-6, both of which abolish learning, alter RIA neuronal property. Together, our results reveal an " ILP-to-ILP" pathway that links environment-sensing neurons, ASI and URX, to the key neuron, RIA, of a network that underlies olfactory plasticity and modulates its activity},

abstract = {(rather crappy) Neuronal ensembles are coactive groups of neurons that may represent building blocks of cortical circuits. These ensembles could be formed by Hebbian plasticity, whereby synapses between coactive neurons are strengthened. Here we report that repetitive activation with two-photon optogenetics of neuronal populations from the visual cortex of awake mice builds neuronal ensembles that recur spontaneously after being imprinted and do not disrupt preexisting ones. Moreover, imprinted ensembles can be recalled by single-cell stimulation and remain coactive on consecutive days. Our results demonstrate the persistent reconfiguration of cortical circuits by two-photon optogenetics into neuronal ensembles that can perform pattern completion},

abstract = {Down syndrome (DS) is caused by triplication of chromosome 21 (HSA21). It is characterised by intellectual disability and impaired motor coordination that arise from changes in brain volume, structure and function. However, the contribution of each HSA21 gene to these various phenotypes and to the causal alterations in neuronal and synaptic structure and function are largely unknown. Here we have investigated the effect of overexpression of the HSA21 gene DSCAM (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule), on glutamatergic synaptic transmission and motor coordination, using Drosophila expressing three copies of Dscam1. Electrophysiological recordings of miniature and evoked excitatory junction potentials at the glutamatergic neuromuscular junction of Drosophila larvae showed that the extra copy of Dscam1 changed the properties of spontaneous and electrically-evoked transmitter release and strengthened short-term synaptic depression during high-frequency firing of the motor nerve. Behavioural analyses uncovered impaired locomotor coordination despite preserved gross motor function. This work identifies DSCAM as a candidate causative gene in DS that is sufficient to modify synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity and cause a DS behavioural phenotype.},

Stem cells are providing hope for many diseases that currently lack effective therapeutic methods, including stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Embryonic stem (ES) cells were originally targeted for differentiation into functional dopamine neurons for cell therapy. Today, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are being tested for such purposes as generating functional dopamine neurons and treating a rat model of Parkinson's disease. In addition, neural stem cell and mesenchymal stem cells are also being used in neurodegenerative disorder therapies for stroke and Parkinson's disease. Although stem cell therapy is still in its infancy, it will likely become a powerful tool for many diseases that currently do not have effective therapeutic approaches.

abstract = {The ability to maintain adequate nutrient intake is critical for survival. Complex interrelated neuronal circuits have developed in the mammalian brain to regulate many aspects of feeding behaviour, from food-seeking to meal termination. The hypothalamus and brainstem are thought to be the principal homeostatic brain areas responsible for regulating body weight. However, in the current 'obesogenic' human environment food intake is largely determined by non-homeostatic factors including cognition, emotion and reward, which are primarily processed in corticolimbic and higher cortical brain regions. Although the pleasure of eating is modulated by satiety and food deprivation increases the reward value of food, there is currently no adequate neurobiological account of this interaction between homeostatic and higher centres in the regulation of food intake in humans. Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, that peptide YY3-36 (PYY), a physiological gut-derived satiety signal, modulates neural activity within both corticolimbic and higher-cortical areas as well as homeostatic brain regions. Under conditions of high plasma PYY concentrations, mimicking the fed state, changes in neural activity within the caudolateral orbital frontal cortex predict feeding behaviour independently of meal-related sensory experiences. In contrast, in conditions of low levels of PYY, hypothalamic activation predicts food intake. Thus, the presence of a postprandial satiety factor switches food intake regulation from a homeostatic to a hedonic, corticolimbic area. Our studies give insights into the neural networks in humans that respond to a specific satiety signal to regulate food intake. An increased understanding of how such homeostatic and higher brain functions are integrated may pave the way for the development of new treatment strategies for obesity.},

abstract = {The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]) has important roles in the triggering of neurotransmitter release and the regulation of short-term plasticity (STP). Transmitter release is initiated by quite high concentrations within microdomains, while short-term facilitation is strongly influenced by the global buildup of "residual calcium." A global rise in [Ca2+] also accelerates the recruitment of release-ready vesicles, thereby controlling the degree of short-term depression (STD) during sustained activity, as well as the recovery of the vesicle pool in periods of rest. We survey data that lead us to propose two distinct roles of [Ca2+] in vesicle recruitment: one accelerating "molecular priming" (vesicle docking and the buildup of a release machinery), the other promoting the tight coupling between releasable vesicles and Ca2+ channels. Such coupling is essential for rendering vesicles sensitive to short [Ca2+] transients, generated during action potentials. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Microdomains exhibit spontaneous increases in calcium (Ca2+), but the mechanisms and functional significance of this localized signaling are unknown. By developing conditional, membrane-anchored GCaMP3 mice, we found that microdomain activity that occurs in the absence of inositol triphosphate (IP3)-dependent release from endoplasmic reticulum arises through Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria during brief openings of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. These microdomain Ca2+ transients were facilitated by the production of reactive oxygen species during oxidative phosphorylation and were enhanced by expression of a mutant form of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1 G93A) that causes astrocyte dysfunction and neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). By localizing mitochondria to microdomains, astrocytes ensure local metabolic support for energetically demanding processes and enable coupling between metabolic demand and Ca2+ signaling events.},

abstract = {1. Capsaicin, the algesic substance in chilli peppers, was injected intradermally in healthy human subjects. A dose of 100 micrograms given in a volume of 10 microliters caused intense pain lasting for a few minutes after injection and resulted in a narrow area of hyperalgesia to heat and a wide surrounding area of hyperalgesia to mechanical stimuli (stroking) lasting for 1-2 h. 2. Nerve compression experiments with selective block of impulse conduction in myelinated (A) but not in unmyelinated (C) fibres indicated that afferent signals in C fibres contributed to pain from capsaicin injection and to heat hyperalgesia, whereas conduction in afferent A fibres was necessary for the perception of mechanical hyperalgesia. 3. Electrical intraneural microstimulation normally eliciting non-painful tactile sensations was accompanied by pain when the sensation was projected to skin areas within the region of mechanical hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin injection. 4. The threshold for pain evoked by intraneural microstimulation was reversibly lowered and pain from suprathreshold stimulation was exaggerated during the period of mechanical hyperalgesia, regardless of lidocaine anaesthesia of the cutaneous innervation territory of the stimulated fibres. 5. The results indicate that hyperalgesia to stroking on a skin area surrounding a painful intradermal injection of capsaicin is due to reversible changes in the central processing of mechanoreceptive input from myelinated fibres which normally evoke non-painful tactile sensations.},

The useful lifetime of first-instar larval preparations is ∼30 min, and that of third-instar CNS preparations is up to 1 h.

abstract = {We use Drosophila larval locomotion as a model to elucidate the working principles of motor circuits. Larval locomotion is generated by rhythmic and sequential contractions of body-wall muscles from the posterior to anterior segments, which in turn are regulated by motor neurons present in the corresponding neuromeres. Motor neurons are known to receive both excitatory and inhibitory inputs, combined action of which likely regulates patterned motor activity during locomotion. Although recent studies identified candidate inhibitory premotor interneurons, the identity of premotor interneurons that provide excitatory drive to motor neurons during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we searched for and identified two putative excitatory premotor interneurons in this system, termed CLI1 and CLI2 (cholinergic lateral interneuron 1 and 2). These neurons were segmentally arrayed and activated sequentially from the posterior to anterior segments during peristalsis. Consistent with their being excitatory premotor interneurons, the CLIs formed GRASP- and ChAT-positive putative synapses with motoneurons and were active just prior to motoneuronal firing in each segment. Moreover, local activation of CLI1s induced contraction of muscles in the corresponding body segments. Taken together, our results suggest that the CLIs directly activate motoneurons sequentially along the segments during larval locomotion.},

Using plasmid electroporation and AAV viral vectors, we delivered CRE-DOG to multiple GFP mouse lines, which led to effective recombination selectively in GFP-labeled cells. Furthermore, CRE-DOG enabled optogenetic control of these neurons.

These are circuits that can be called into action for perceptual, conceptual, and motor tasks, and we now need to understand whether there are coherent and overriding principles that govern the design and function of these modules. The discovery of central motor programs has provided crucial insight into the logic of one prototypic set of neural circuits: those that generate motor patterns.

This sensory variation was noted across the entire genus and appears to represent repeated, independent evolutionary events, where one sensory modality is consistently selected for at the expense of the other. Moreover, we provide evidence of a developmental genetic constraint through the sharing of a single larval structure, the eye-antennal imaginal disc.

Some ligands are coexpressed in cis with their receptors, raising the question of the relative contribution of cis and trans interactions to axon guidance. Spinal motor axons use Eph receptors to select a limb trajectory in response to trans ephrins, while expressing ephrins in cis. We show that changes in motor neuron ephrin expression result in trajectory selection defects mirrored by changes in growth cone sensitivity to ephrins in vitro, arguing for ephrin cis-attenuation of Eph function. Furthermore, the relative contribution of trans-signaling and cis-attenuation is influenced by the subcellular distribution of ephrins to membrane patches containing Eph receptors. Thus, growth cone ephrins are essential for axon guidance in vivo and the balance between cis and trans modes of axon guidance ligand-receptor interaction contributes to the diversity of axon guidance signaling responses. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Asymmetric divisions of radial glia progenitors produce self-renewing radial glia and differentiating cells simultaneously in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the developing neocortex. Whereas differentiating cells leave the VZ to constitute the future neocortex, renewing radial glia progenitors stay in the VZ for subsequent divisions. The differential behaviour of progenitors and their differentiating progeny is essential for neocortical development; however, the mechanisms that ensure these behavioural differences are unclear. Here we show that asymmetric centrosome inheritance regulates the differential behaviour of renewing progenitors and their differentiating progeny in the embryonic mouse neocortex. Centrosome duplication in dividing radial glia progenitors generates a pair of centrosomes with differently aged mother centrioles. During peak phases of neurogenesis, the centrosome retaining the old mother centriole stays in the VZ and is preferentially inherited by radial glia progenitors, whereas the centrosome containing the new mother centriole mostly leaves the VZ and is largely associated with differentiating cells. Removal of ninein, a mature centriole-specific protein, disrupts the asymmetric segregation and inheritance of the centrosome and causes premature depletion of progenitors from the VZ. These results indicate that preferential inheritance of the centrosome with the mature older mother centriole is required for maintaining radial glia progenitors in the developing mammalian neocortex.},

abstract = {Locomotion in an organism is a consequence of the coupled interaction between brain, body and environment. Motivated by qualitative observations and quantitative perturbations of crawling in Drosophila melanogaster larvae, we construct a minimal integrative mathematical model for its locomotion. Our model couples the excitation-inhibition circuits in the nervous system to force production in the muscles and body movement in a frictional environment, thence linking neural dynamics to body mechanics via sensory feedback in a heterogeneous environment. Our results explain the basic observed phenomenology of crawling with and without proprioception, and elucidate the stabilizing role that proprioception plays in producing a robust crawling phenotype in the presence of biological perturbations. More generally, our approach allows us to make testable predictions on the effect of changing body-environment interactions on crawling, and serves as a step in the development of hierarchical models linking cellular processes to behavior. {\textcopyright}Pehlevan et al.},

abstract = {Studies of mating preferences have largely neglected the potential effects of individuals encountering their previous mates ('directly sexually familiar'), or new mates that share similarities to previous mates, e.g. from the same family and/or environment ('phenotypically sexually familiar'). Here, we show that male and female Drosophila melanogaster respond to the direct and phenotypic sexual familiarity of potential mates in fundamentally different ways. We exposed a single focal male or female to two potential partners. In the first experiment, one potential partner was novel (not previously encountered) and one was directly familiar (their previous mate); in the second experiment, one potential partner was novel (unrelated, and from a different environment from the previous mate) and one was phenotypically familiar (from the same family and rearing environment as the previous mate). We found that males preferentially courted novel females over directly or phenotypically familiar females. By contrast, females displayed a weak preference for directly and phenotypically familiar males over novel males. Sex-specific responses to the familiarity of potential mates were significantly weaker or absent in Orco(1) mutants, which lack a co-receptor essential for olfaction, indicating a role for olfactory cues in mate choice over novelty. Collectively, our results show that direct and phenotypic sexual familiarity is detected through olfactory cues and play an important role in sex-specific sexual behaviour.},

This is reflected in the impact of aberrant mTOR signalling on a number of major human diseases and has helped to drive research to understand how TOR (target of rapamycin) is itself regulated. While it is clear that amino acids can affect TOR signalling, how these molecules are sensed by TOR remains controversial, perhaps because cells use different mechanisms as environmental conditions change. Even the question of whether they have an effect inside the cell or at its surface remains unresolved. The present review summarizes current ideas and suggests ways in which some of the models proposed might be unified to produce an amino acid detection system that can adapt to environmental change.},

Recent data suggest that neurons expressing three markers, the Ca2+-binding protein parvalbumin (PV), the neuropeptide somatostatin (SST), and the ionotropic serotonin receptor 5HT3a (5HT3aR) account for nearly 100{\%} of neocortical interneurons. Interneurons expressing each of these markers have a different embryological origin. Each group includes several types of interneurons that differ in morphological and electrophysiological properties and likely have different functions in the cortical circuit. The PV group accounts for ∼40{\%} of GABAergic neurons and includes fast spiking basket cells and chandelier cells. The SST group, which represents ∼30{\%} of GABAergic neurons, includes the Martinotti cells and a set of neurons that specifically target layerIV. The 5HT3aR group, which also accounts for ∼30{\%} of the total interneuronal population, is heterogeneous and includes all of the neurons that express the neuropeptide VIP, as well as an equally numerous subgroup of neurons that do not express VIP and includes neurogliaform cells. The universal modulation of these neurons by serotonin and acetylcholine via ionotropic receptors suggests that they might be involved in shaping cortical circuits during specific brain states and behavioral contexts.},

abstract = {Precise patterns of motor neuron connectivity depend on the proper establishment and positioning of the dendritic arbor. However, how different motor neurons orient their dendrites to selectively establish synaptic connectivity is not well understood. The Drosophila neuromuscular system provides a simple model to investigate the underlying organizational principles by which distinct subclasses of motor neurons orient their dendrites within the central neuropil. Here we used genetic mosaic techniques to characterize the diverse dendritic morphologies of individual motor neurons from five main nerve branches (ISN, ISNb, ISNd, SNa, and SNc) in the Drosophila larva. We found that motor neurons from different nerve branches project their dendrites to largely stereotyped mediolateral domains in the dorsal region of the neuropil providing full coverage of the receptive territory. Furthermore, dendrites from different motor neurons overlap extensively, regardless of subclass, suggesting that repulsive dendrite-dendrite interactions between motor neurons do not influence the mediolateral positioning of dendritic fields. The anatomical data in this study provide important information regarding how different subclasses of motor neurons organize their dendrites and establishes a foundation for the investigation of the mechanisms that control synaptic connectivity in the Drosophila motor circuit. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Rhythmic animal behaviors are regulated in part by neural circuits called the central pattern generators (CPGs). Classifying neural population activities correlated with body movements and identifying the associated component neurons are critical steps in understanding CPGs. Previous methods that classify neural dynamics obtained by dimension reduction algorithms often require manual optimization which could be laborious and preparation-specific. Here, we present a simpler and more flexible method that is based on the pre-trained convolutional neural network model VGG-16 and unsupervised learning, and successfully classifies the fictive motor patterns in Drosophila larvae under various imaging conditions. We also used voxel-wise correlation mapping to identify neurons associated with motor patterns. By applying these methods to neurons targeted by 5-HT2A-GAL4, which we generated by the CRISPR/Cas9-system, we identified two classes of interneurons, termed Seta and Leta, which are specifically active during backward but not forward fictive locomotion. Optogenetic activation of Seta and Leta neurons increased backward locomotion. Conversely, thermogenetic inhibition of 5-HT2A-GAL4 neurons or application of a 5-HT2 antagonist decreased backward locomotion induced by noxious light stimuli. This study establishes an accelerated pipeline for activity profiling and cell identification in larval Drosophila and implicates the serotonergic system in the modulation of backward locomotion.},

abstract = {Dent's disease is an X-linked disorder associated with the urinary loss of low-molecular-weight proteins, phosphate and calcium, which often leads to kidney stones. It is caused by mutations in ClC-5, a renal chloride channel that is expressed in endosomes of the proximal tubule. Here we show that disruption of the mouse clcn5 gene causes proteinuria by strongly reducing apical proximal tubular endocytosis. Both receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis are affected, and the internalization of the apical transporters NaPi-2 and NHE3 is slowed. At steady state, however, both proteins are redistributed from the plasma membrane to intracellular vesicles. This may be caused by an increased stimulation of luminal parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptors owing to the observed decreased tubular endocytosis of PTH. The rise in luminal PTH concentration should also stimulate the hydroxylation of 25(OH) vitamin D3 to the active hormone. However, this is counteracted by a urinary loss of the precursor 25(OH) vitamin D3. The balance between these opposing effects, both of which are secondary to the defect in proximal tubular endocytosis, probably determines whether there will be hypercalciuria and kidney stones.},

abstract = {The intervals between acoustic elements are important in audition. Although neurons have been recorded that show interval tuning, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The anuran auditory system is well suited for addressing this problem. One class of midbrain neurons in anurans responds selectively over a narrow range of pulse-repetition rates (PRRs) and only after several sound pulses have occurred with the "correct" timing. This "interval-counting" process can be reset by a single incorrect interval. Here we show, from whole-cell patch recordings of midbrain neurons in vivo, that these computations result from interplay between inhibition and rate-dependent excitation. An individual pulse or slowly repeated pulses elicited inhibition and subthreshold excitation. Excitation was markedly enhanced, however, when PRR was increased over a neuron-specific range. Spikes were produced when the enhanced excitation overcame the inhibition. Interval-number thresholds were positively correlated with the strength of inhibition and number of intervals required to augment the excitation. Accordingly, interval-number thresholds decreased when inhibition was attenuated by loading cells with cesium fluoride. The selectivity of these neurons for the interpulse interval, and therefore PRR, was related to the time course of excitatory events and the rate dependence of enhancement; for cells that were tuned to longer intervals, EPSPs were broader, and enhancement occurred at slower PRRs. The frequency tuning of the inhibition generally spanned that of the excitation, consistent with its role in temporal computation. These findings provide the first mechanistic understanding of interval selectivity and counting in the nervous system.},

Several studies have suggested that behavior during the immature larval stages of Drosophila development is influenced by pheromones, but none of these compounds or the pheromone-receptor neurons that sense them have been identified. Here we report a larval pheromone-signaling pathway. We found that larvae produce two novel long-chain fatty acids that are attractive to other larvae. We identified a single larval chemosensory neuron that detects these molecules. Two members of the pickpocket family of DEG/ENaC channel subunits (ppk23 and ppk29) are required to respond to these pheromones. This pheromone system is evolving quickly, since the larval exudates of D. simulans, the sister species of D. melanogaster, are not attractive to other larvae. Our results define a new pheromone signaling system in Drosophila that shares characteristics with pheromone systems in a wide diversity of insects.},

abstract = {In voltage-gated cation channels, a recurrent pattern for mutations is the neutralization of positively charged residues in the voltage-sensing S4 transmembrane segments. These mutations cause dominant ion channelopathies affecting many tissues such as brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. Recent studies suggest that the pathogenesis of associated phenotypes is not limited to alterations in the gating of the ion-conducting alpha pore. Instead, aberrant so-called omega currents, facilitated by the movement of mutated S4 segments, also appear to contribute to symptoms. Surprisingly, these omega currents conduct cations with varying ion selectivity and are activated in either a hyperpolarized or depolarized voltage range. This review gives an overview of voltage sensor channelopathies in general and focuses on pathogenesis of skeletal muscle S4 disorders for which current knowledge is most advanced.},

@article{Malenka1989,
abstract = {The phenomenon of long-term potentiation (LTP), a long lasting increase in the strength of synaptic transmission which is due to brief, repetitive activation of excitatory afferent fibres, is one of the most striking examples of synaptic plasticity in the mammalian brain. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the induction of LTP requires activation of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors by synaptically released glutamate with concomitant postsynaptic membrane depolarization. This relieves the voltage-dependent magnesium block of the NMDA-receptor ion channel, allowing calcium to flow into the dendritic spine. Although calcium has been shown to be a necessary trigger for LTP (refs 11, 12), little is known about the immediate biochemical processes that are activated by calcium and are responsible for LTP. The most attractive candidates have been calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-KII) (refs 13-16), protein kinase C (refs 17-19), and the calcium-dependent protease, calpain. Extracellular application of protein kinase inhibitors to the hippocampal slice preparation blocks the induction of LTP (refs 21-23) but it is unclear whether this is due to a pre- and/or postsynaptic action. We have found that intracellular injection into CA1 pyramidal cells of the protein kinase inhibitor H-7, or of the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium, blocks LTP. Furthermore, LTP is blocked by the injection of synthetic peptides that are potent calmodulin antagonists and inhibit CaM-KII auto- and substrate phosphorylation. These findings demonstrate that in the postsynaptic cell both activation of calmodulin and kinase activity are required for the generation of LTP, and focus further attention on the potential role of CaM-KII in LTP.},

abstract = {Repeated exposure to cocaine alters the structural and functional properties of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These changes suggest a rewiring of the NAc circuit, with an enhancement of excitatory synaptic connections onto MSNs. However, it is unknown how drug exposure alters the balance of long-range afferents onto different cell types in the NAc. Here we used whole-cell recordings, two-photon microscopy, optogenetics and pharmacogenetics to show how repeated cocaine exposure alters connectivity in the mouse NAc medial shell. Cocaine selectively enhanced amygdala innervation of MSNs expressing D1 dopamine receptors (D1-MSNs) relative to D2-MSNs. We also found that amygdala activity was required for cocaine-induced changes to behavior and connectivity. Finally, we established how heightened amygdala innervation can explain the structural and functional changes evoked by cocaine. Our findings reveal how exposure to drugs of abuse fundamentally reorganizes cell type- and input-specific connectivity in the NAc.},

abstract = {The role played by the sex-determining gene doublesex (dsx) and its influence on Drosophila courtship were examined. Against a background of subnormal male-like behavior that is reported to be an attribute of haplo-X flies homozygous for the original dsx mutation, and given that a sex-specific muscle is unaffected by genetic variation at this locus, analyses of several reproductive behaviors and control for genetic background effects indicated that XY dsx mutants are impaired in their willingness to court females. When they did court, certain behavioral actions were normal, including components of courtship song. However, these mutants never produced courtship humming sounds. Mature XY dsx flies elicited anomalously high levels of courtship; that this occurs merely because of a delay in imaginal development was experimentally discounted. The current analysis reconciled two ostensibly conflicting reports involving the courtship-stimulating qualities of this mutant type. Such experiments also uncovered a new behavioral anomaly; dsx mutations caused chromosomal males to court other males at abnormally high levels. These results are discussed from the perspective of doublesex's influence on internal tissues of adult drosophila involved in the triggering and neural control of male-and female-like elements of courtship, reproductive pheromone production, or a combination of such factors.},

However, in the absence of a circadian clock, overall sleep-wake rhythmicity is preserved and remains synchronized to the external light-dark cycle, indicating that there is an additional, clock-independent photic input to sleep. We found that the direct photic regulation of sleep in mice is predominantly mediated by melanopsin (OPN4)-based photoreception of photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (pRGCs). Moreover, OPN4-dependent sleep regulation was correlated with the activation of sleep-promoting neurons in the ventrolateral preoptic area and the superior colliculus. Collectively, our findings describe a previously unknown pathway in sleep regulation and identify the pRGC/OPN4 signaling system as a potentially new pharmacological target for the selective manipulation of sleep and arousal states.},

abstract = {Drosophila larval crawling is a simple behavior that allows us to dissect the functions of specific neurons in the intact animal and explore the roles of genes in the specification of those neurons. By inhibiting subsets of neurons in the PNS, we have found that two classes of multidendritic neurons play a major role in larval crawling. The bipolar dendrites and class I mds send a feedback signal to the CNS that keeps the contraction wave progressing quickly, allowing smooth forward movement. Genetic manipulation of the sensory neurons suggests that this feedback depends on proper dendritic morphology and axon pathfinding to appropriate synaptic target areas in the CNS. Our data suggest that coordination of muscle activity in larval crawling requires feedback from neurons acting as proprioceptors, sending a "mission accomplished" signal in response to segment contraction, and resulting in rapid relaxation of the segment and propagation of the wave. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Using plasmid electroporation and AAV viral vectors, we delivered CRE-DOG to multiple GFP mouse lines, which led to effective recombination selectively in GFP-labeled cells. Furthermore, CRE-DOG enabled optogenetic control of these neurons. Beyond providing a new set of tools for manipulation of gene expression selectively in GFP+ cells, we found that GFP can be used to reconstitute the activity of a protein not known to have a modular structure, suggesting that this strategy might be applicable to a wide range of proteins.},

In three consanguineous families from northern Pakistan, we mapped the condition as an autosomal-recessive trait to chromosome 2q24.3. This region contains the gene SCN9A, encoding the alpha-subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel, Na(v)1.7, which is strongly expressed in nociceptive neurons. Sequence analysis of SCN9A in affected individuals revealed three distinct homozygous nonsense mutations (S459X, I767X and W897X). We show that these mutations cause loss of function of Na(v)1.7 by co-expression of wild-type or mutant human Na(v)1.7 with sodium channel beta(1) and beta(2) subunits in HEK293 cells. In cells expressing mutant Na(v)1.7, the currents were no greater than background. Our data suggest that SCN9A is an essential and non-redundant requirement for nociception in humans. These findings should stimulate the search for novel analgesics that selectively target this sodium channel subunit.},

Here we demonstrate an accurate, inexpensive, and scalable method for estimating consumption expenditure and asset wealth from high-resolution satellite imagery. Using survey and satellite data from five African countries-Nigeria,Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Rwanda-we show how a convolutional neural network can be trained to identify image features that can explain up to 75{\%}of the variation in local-level economic outcomes. Our method, which requires only publicly available data, could transform efforts to track and target poverty in developing countries. It also demonstrates how powerful machine learning techniques can be applied in a setting with limited training data, suggesting broad potential application across many scientific domains.},

abstract = {An efficient strategy to explore the environment for available resources involves the execution of random walks where straight line locomotion alternates with changes of direction. This strategy is highly conserved in the animal kingdom, from zooplankton to human hunter-gatherers [1-8]. Drosophila larvae execute a routine of this kind, performing straight line crawling interrupted at intervals by pause turns that halt crawling and redirect the trajectory of movement [9-11]. The execution of this routine depends solely on the activity of networks located in the thoracic and abdominal segments of the nervous system, while descending input from the brain serves to modify it in a context-dependent fashion [9]. I used a genetic method to investigate the location and function of the circuitry required for the different elements of exploratory crawling. By using the Slit-Robo axon guidance pathway to target neuronal midline crossing defects selectively to particular regions of the thoracic and abdominal networks, it has been possible to define at least three functions required for the performance of the exploratory routine: (1) symmetrical outputs in thoracic and abdominal segments that generate the crawls; (2) asymmetrical output that is uniquely initiated in the thoracic segments and generates the turns; and (3) an intermittent interruption to crawling that determines the time-dependent transition between crawls and turns.},

Here we review recent studies indicating that rodents are able to share states of fear, and highlight how affective neuroscience approaches to the study of primary-process emotional systems can help to delineate how primal empathy is constituted in mammalian brains. Cross-species evolutionary approaches to understanding the neural circuitry of emotional 'contagion' or 'resonance' between nearby animals, together with the underlying neurochemistries, may help to clarify the origins of human empathy. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Cortical GABAergic dysfunction may underlie the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. Here, we characterized a mouse strain in which the essential NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) was selectively eliminated in 40-50{\%} of cortical and hippocampal interneurons in early postnatal development. Consistent with the NMDAR hypofunction theory of schizophrenia, distinct schizophrenia-related symptoms emerged after adolescence, including novelty-induced hyperlocomotion, mating and nest-building deficits, as well as anhedonia-like and anxiety-like behaviors. Many of these behaviors were exacerbated by social isolation stress. Social memory, spatial working memory and prepulse inhibition were also impaired. Reduced expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 and parvalbumin was accompanied by disinhibition of cortical excitatory neurons and reduced neuronal synchrony. Postadolescent deletion of NR1 did not result in such abnormalities. These findings suggest that early postnatal inhibition of NMDAR activity in corticolimbic GABAergic interneurons contributes to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia-related disorders.},

abstract = {In Drosophila melanogaster, the somatic muscle system is first formed during embryogenesis, giving rise to the larval musculature. Later during metamorphosis, this system is destroyed and replaced by an entirely new set of muscles in the adult fly. Proper formation of the larval and adult muscles is critical for basic survival functions such as hatching and crawling (in the larva), walking and flying (in the adult), and feeding (at both larval and adult stages). Myogenesis, from mononucleated muscle precursor cells to multinucleated functional muscles, is driven by a number of cellular processes that have begun to be mechanistically defined. Once the mesodermal cells destined for the myogenic lineage have been specified, individual myoblasts fuse together iteratively to form syncytial myofibers. Combining cytoplasmic contents demands a level of intracellular reorganization that, most notably, leads to redistribution of the myonuclei to maximize internuclear distance. Signaling from extending myofibers induces terminal tendon cell differentiation in the ectoderm, which results in secure muscle-tendon attachments that are critical for muscle contraction. Simultaneously, muscles become innervated and undergo sarcomerogenesis to establish the contractile apparatus that will facilitate movement. The cellular mechanisms governing these morphogenetic events share numerous parallels to mammalian development, and the basic unit of all muscle, the myofiber, is conserved from flies to mammals. Thus, studies of Drosophila myogenesis and comparisons to muscle development in other systems highlight conserved regulatory programs of biomedical relevance to general muscle biology and studies of muscle disease.},

abstract = {Serotonin is implicated in mood regulation, and drugs acting via the serotonergic system are effective in treating anxiety and depression. Specifically, agonists of the serotonin1A receptor have anxiolytic properties, and knockout mice lacking this receptor show increased anxiety-like behaviour. Here we use a tissue-specific, conditional rescue strategy to show that expression of the serotonin1A receptor primarily in the hippocampus and cortex, but not in the raphe nuclei, is sufficient to rescue the behavioural phenotype of the knockout mice. Furthermore, using the conditional nature of these transgenic mice, we suggest that receptor expression during the early postnatal period, but not in the adult, is necessary for this behavioural rescue. These findings show that postnatal developmental processes help to establish adult anxiety-like behaviour. In addition, the normal role of the serotonin1A receptor during development may be different from its function when this receptor is activated by therapeutic intervention in adulthood.},

The primary somatosensory cortex has an exquisite somatotopic map where each individual whisker is represented in a discrete anatomical unit, the "barrel," allowing precise delineation of functional organization, development, and plasticity. Sensory information is actively acquired in awake behaving rodents and processed differently within the barrel map depending upon whisker-related behavior. The prominence of state-dependent cortical sensory processing is likely to be crucial in our understanding of active sensory perception, experience-dependent plasticity and learning.},

abstract = {Social interactions occur between multiple individuals, but what is the detailed relationship between the neural dynamics across their brains? To address this question across timescales and levels of neural activity, we used wireless electrophysiology to simultaneously record from pairs of bats engaged in a wide range of natural social interactions. We found that neural activity was remarkably correlated between their brains over timescales from seconds to hours. The correlation depended on a shared social environment and was most prominent in high frequency local field potentials ({\textgreater}30 Hz), followed by local spiking activity. Furthermore, the degree of neural correlation covaried with the extent of social interactions, and an increase in correlation preceded their initiation. These results show that inter-brain correlation is an inherent feature of natural social interactions, reveal the domain of neural activity where it is most prominent, and provide a foundation for studying its functional role in social behaviors.},

abstract = {The rich behavioral repertoire of animals is encoded in the CNS as a set of motorneuron activation patterns, also called 'motor synergies'. However, the neurons that orchestrate these motor programs as well as their cellular properties and connectivity are poorly understood. Here we identify a population of molecularly defined motor synergy encoder (MSE) neurons in the mouse spinal cord that may represent a central node in neural pathways for voluntary and reflexive movement. This population receives direct inputs from the motor cortex and sensory pathways and, in turn, has monosynaptic outputs to spinal motorneurons. Optical stimulation of MSE neurons drove reliable patterns of activity in multiple motor groups, and we found that the evoked motor patterns varied on the basis of the rostrocaudal location of the stimulated MSE. We speculate that these neurons comprise a cellular network for encoding coordinated motor output programs.},

abstract = {In Drosophila melanogaster, genes of the sex-determination hierarchy orchestrate the development and differentiation of sex-specific tissues, establishing sex-specific physiology and neural circuitry. One of these sex-determination genes, fruitless (fru), plays a key role in the formation of neural circuits underlying Drosophila male courtship behavior. Conservation of fru gene structure and sex-specific expression has been found in several insect orders, though it is still to be determined whether a male courtship role for the gene is employed in these species due to the lack of mutants and homologous experimental evidence. We have isolated the fru ortholog (Md-fru) from the common housefly, Musca domestica, and show the gene's conserved genomic structure. We demonstrate that male-specific Md-fru transcripts arise by conserved mechanisms of sex-specific splicing. Here we show that Md-fru, is similarly involved in controlling male courtship behavior. A male courtship behavioral function for Md-fru was revealed by the behavioral and neuroanatomical analyses of a hypomorphic allele, Md-traman, which specifically disrupted the expression of Md-fru in males, leading to severely impaired male courtship behavior. In line with a role in nervous system development, we found that expression of Md-fru was confined to neural tissues in the brain, most prominently in optic neuropil and in peripheral sensory organs. We propose that, like in Drosophila, overt sexual differentiation of the housefly depends on a sex-determining pathway that bifurcates downstream of the Md-tra gene to coordinate dimorphic development of non-neuronal tissues mediated by Md-dsx with that of neuronal tissues largely mediated by Md-fru. {\textcopyright} 2013 Meier et al.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Polymorphisms within the FTO gene have consistently been associated with obesity across multiple populations. However, to date, it is not known whether the association between genetic variation in FTO and obesity is mediated through effects on energy intake or energy expenditure. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine the association between alleles of FTO known to increase obesity risk and measures of habitual appetitive behavior. METHODS: The intronic FTO single nucleotide polymorphism (rs9939609) was genotyped in 3337 United Kingdom children in whom measures of habitual appetitive behavior had been assessed using two scales (Satiety Responsiveness and Enjoyment of Food) from the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, a psychometric tool that has been validated against objective measures of food intake. Associations of FTO genotype with indices of adiposity and appetite were assessed by ANOVA. RESULTS: As expected, the A allele was associated with increased adiposity in this cohort and in an independent case-control replication study of United Kingdom children of similar age. AA homozygotes had significantly reduced Satiety Responsiveness scores (P = 0.008, ANOVA). Mediation analysis indicated that the association of the AA genotype with increased adiposity was explained in part through effects on Satiety Responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: We have used a unique dataset to examine the relationship between a validated measure of children's habitual appetitive behavior and FTO obesity risk genotype and conclude that the commonest known risk allele for obesity is likely to exert at least some of its effects by influencing appetite.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Ephrin receptors interact with membrane-bound ephrin ligands to regulate contact-mediated attraction or repulsion between opposing cells, thereby influencing tissue morphogenesis. Cell repulsion requires bidirectional trans-endocytosis of clustered Eph–ephrin complexes at cell interfaces, but the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we identified an actin-regulating pathway allowing ephrinB {\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} cells to trans-endocytose EphB receptors from opposing cells. Live imaging revealed Rac-dependent F-actin enrichment at sites of EphB2 internalization, but not during vesicle trafficking. Systematic depletion of Rho family GTPases and their regulatory proteins identified the Rac subfamily and the Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam2 as key components of EphB2 trans-endocytosis, a pathway previously implicated in Eph forward signaling, in which ephrins act as in trans ligands of Eph receptors. However, unlike in Eph signaling, this pathway is not required for uptake of soluble ligands in ephrinB {\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} cells. We also show that this pathway is required for EphB2-stimulated contact repulsion. These results support the existence of a conserved pathway for EphB trans-endocytosis that removes the physical tether between cells, thereby enabling cell repulsion. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {How learning and memory is achieved in the brain is a central question in neuroscience. Key to today's research into information storage in the brain is the concept of synaptic plasticity, a notion that has been heavily influenced by Hebb's (1949) postulate. Hebb conjectured that repeatedly and persistently co-active cells should increase connective strength among populations of interconnected neurons as a means of storing a memory trace, also known as an engram. Hebb certainly was not the first to make such a conjecture, as we show in this history. Nevertheless, literally thousands of studies into the classical frequency-dependent paradigm of cellular learning rules were directly inspired by the Hebbian postulate. But in more recent years, a novel concept in cellular learning has emerged, where temporal order instead of frequency is emphasized. This new learning paradigm - known as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) - has rapidly gained tremendous interest, perhaps because of its combination of elegant simplicity, biological plausibility, and computational power. But what are the roots of today's STDP concept? Here, we discuss several centuries of diverse thinking, beginning with philosophers such as Aristotle, Locke, and Ribot, traversing, e.g., Lugaro's plasticit{\`{a}} and Rosenblatt's perceptron, and culminating with the discovery of STDP. We highlight interactions between theoretical and experimental fields, showing how discoveries sometimes occurred in parallel, seemingly without much knowledge of the other field, and sometimes via concrete back-and-forth communication. We point out where the future directions may lie, which includes interneuron STDP, the functional impact of STDP, its mechanisms and its neuromodulatory regulation, and the linking of STDP to the developmental formation and continuous plasticity of neuronal networks.},

abstract = {Studies of the innervation of limb muscles by spinal motor neurons have helped to define mechanisms by which axons establish trajectories to their targets. Related motor axons select dorsal or ventral pathways at the base of the limb, raising the question of how these alternate trajectories are specified. EphA signaling has been proposed to control the dorsal trajectory of motor axons in conjunction with other signaling systems, although the respective contributions of each system to motor axon guidance are unclear. We show that the expression of EphB receptors by motor axons, and ephrin-B ligands by limb mesenchymal cells, directs the ventral trajectory of motor axons. Our findings reveal symmetry in the molecular strategies that establish this aspect of nerve-muscle connectivity. The involvement of ephrin:Eph signaling in guiding both sets of motor axons raises the possibility that other signaling systems function primarily to refine or modulate a core Eph signaling program. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping in amygdala slices and cell-specific viral tracing indicate that PKC-$\delta$(+) neurons inhibit output neurons in the medial central amygdala (CEm), and also make reciprocal inhibitory synapses with PKC-$\delta$(-) neurons in CEl. Electrical silencing of PKC-$\delta$(+) neurons in vivo suggests that they correspond to physiologically identified units that are inhibited by the conditioned stimulus, called CEl(off) units. This correspondence, together with behavioural data, defines an inhibitory microcircuit in CEl that gates CEm output to control the level of conditioned freezing.},

abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is a widely studied cellular example of synaptic plasticity. However, the identity, localization, and interplay among the biochemical signals underlying LTP remain unclear. Intracellular microelectrodes have been used to record synaptic potentials and deliver protein kinase inhibitors to postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal cells. Induction of LTP is blocked by intracellular delivery of H-7, a general protein kinase inhibitor, or PKC(19-31), a selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, or CaMKII(273-302), a selective inhibitor of the multifunctional Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII). After its establishment, LTP appears unresponsive to postsynaptic H-7, although it remains sensitive to externally applied H-7. Thus both postsynaptic PKC and CaMKII are required for the induction of LTP and a presynaptic protein kinase appears to be necessary for the expression of LTP.},

abstract = {Insect dendritic arborization (da) neurons provide an opportunity to examine how diverse dendrite morphologies and dendritic territories are established during development. We have examined the morphologies of Drosophila da neurons by using the MARCM (mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker) system. We show that each of the 15 neurons per abdominal hemisegment spread dendrites to characteristic regions of the epidermis. We place these neurons into four distinct morphological classes distinguished primarily by their dendrite branching complexities. Some class assignments correlate with known proneural gene requirements as well as with central axonal projections. Our data indicate that cells within two morphological classes partition the body wall into distinct, non-overlapping territorial domains and thus are organized as separate tiled sensory systems. The dendritic domains of cells in different classes, by contrast, can overlap extensively. We have examined the cell-autonomous roles of starry night (stan) (also known as flamingo (fmi)) and sequoia (seq) in tiling. Neurons with these genes mutated generally terminate their dendritic fields at normal locations at the lateral margin and segment border, where they meet or approach the like dendrites of adjacent neurons. However, stan mutant neurons occasionally send sparsely branched processes beyond these territories that could potentially mix with adjacent like dendrites. Together, our data suggest that widespread tiling of the larval body wall involves interactions between growing dendritic processes and as yet unidentified signals that allow avoidance by like dendrites.},

We developed driver and double reporter mouse lines and viral vectors using the Cre/Flp and Cre/Dre double recombinase systems and established a new, retargetable genomic locus, TIGRE, which allowed the generation of a large set of Cre/tTA-dependent reporter lines expressing fluorescent proteins, genetically encoded calcium, voltage, or glutamate indicators, and optogenetic effectors, all at substantially higher levels than before. High functionality was shown in example mouse lines for GCaMP6, YCX2.60, VSFP Butterfly 1.2, and Jaws.

The phenotypes of new fru mutants encompass nearly all aspects of male sexual behavior. Alternative splicing of fru transcripts produces sex-specific proteins belonging to the BTB-ZF family of transcriptional regulators. The sex-specific fru products are produced in only about 500 of the 105 neurons that comprise the CNS. The properties of neurons expressing these fru products suggest that fru specifies the fates or activities of neurons that carry out higher order control functions to elicit and coordinate the activities comprising male courtship behavior.},

abstract = {Background: Size regulation is fundamental in developing multicellular organisms and occurs through the control of cell number and cell size. Studies in Drosophila have identified an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that regulates organismal size and that includes the Drosophila insulin receptor substrate homolog Chico, the lipid kinase PI(3)K (Dp110), DAkt1/dPKB, and dS6K. Results: We demonstrate that varying the activity of the Drosophila insulin receptor homolog (Dlnr) during development regulates organ size by changing cell size and cell number in a cell-autonomous manner. An amino acid substitution at the corresponding position in the kinase domain of the human and Drosophila insulin receptors causes severe growth retardation. Furthermore, we show that the Drosophila genome contains seven insulin-like genes that are expressed in a highly tissue- and stagespecific pattern. Overexpression of one of these insulin-like genes alters growth control in a Dlnr-dependent manner. Conclusions: This study shows that the Drosophila insulin receptor autonomously controls cell and organ size, and that overexpression of a gene encoding an insulin-like peptide is sufficient to increase body size.},

In the nervous system, we detected differences between the sexes in dsx-positive neuronal numbers, axonal projections and synaptic density. We found that dsx was required for the development of male-specific neurons that coexpressed fruitless (fru), a regulator of male sexual behavior. We propose that dsx and fru act together to form the neuronal framework necessary for male sexual behavior. We found that disrupting dsx neuronal function had profound effects on male sexual behavior. Furthermore, our results suggest that dsx-positive neurons are involved in pre- to post-copulatory female reproductive behaviors.},

abstract = {Agonist-evoked cytosolic Ca(2+) spikes in mouse pancreatic acinar cells are specifically initiated in the apical secretory pole and are mostly confined to this region. The role played by mitochondria in this process has been investigated. Using the mitochondria-specific fluorescent dyes MitoTracker Green and Rhodamine 123, these organelles appeared as a bright belt concentrated mainly around the secretory granule area. We tested the effects of two different types of mitochondrial inhibitor on the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration using simultaneous imaging of Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescence (Fura 2) and electrophysiology. When carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was applied in the presence of the Ca(2+)-releasing messenger inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate (IP(3)), the local repetitive Ca(2+) responses in the granule area were transformed into a global rise in the cellular Ca(2+) concentration. In the absence of IP(3), CCCP had no effect on the cytosolic Ca(2+) levels. Antimycin and antimycin + oligomycin had the same effect as CCCP. Active mitochondria, strategically placed around the secretory pole, block Ca(2+) diffusion from the primary Ca(2+) release sites in the granule-rich area in the apical pole to the basal part of the cell containing the nucleus. When mitochondrial function is inhibited, this barrier disappears and the Ca(2+) signals spread all over the cytosol.},

abstract = {Comorbidity is a major issue in psychiatry that notably associates with more severe symptoms, longer illness duration, and higher service utilization. Therefore, identifying key clusters of comorbidity and exploring the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms represent important steps toward improving mental health care. In the present review, we focus on the frequent association between addiction and depression. In particular, we summarize the large body of evidence from preclinical models indicating that the kappa opioid receptor (KOR), a member of the opioid neuromodulatory system, represents a central player in the regulation of both reward and mood processes. Current data suggest that the KOR modulates overlapping neuronal networks linking brainstem monoaminergic nuclei with forebrain limbic structures. Rewarding properties of both drugs of abuse and natural stimuli, as well as the neurobiological effects of stressful experiences, strongly interact at the level of KOR signaling. In addiction models, activity of the KOR is potentiated by stressors and critically controls drug-seeking and relapse. In depression paradigms, KOR signaling is responsive to a variety of stressors, and mediates despair-like responses. Altogether, the KOR represents a prototypical substrate of comorbidity, whereby life experiences converge upon common brain mechanisms to trigger behavioral dysregulation and increased risk for distinct but interacting psychopathologies.},

In rat-1 fibroblasts, up to three consecutive daily oscillations with an average period length of 22.5 hr could be recorded. The temporal sequence of the various mRNA accumulation cycles is the same in cultured cells and in vivo. The serum shock of rat-1 fibroblasts also results in a transient stimulation of c-fos and rper expression and thus mimics light-induced immediate-early gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.},

abstract = {Courtship in Drosophila melanogaster has become an iconic example of an innate and interactive series of behaviors [1-11]. The female signals her acceptance of copulation by becoming immobile in response to a male's display of stereotyped actions. The male and female communicate via vision, air-borne sounds, and pheromones [1, 2], but what triggers the female's immobility is undetermined. Here, we describe an overlooked and important component of Drosophila courtship. Video recordings and laser vibrometry show that the male abdomen shakes ("quivers"), generating substrate-borne vibrations at about six pulses per second. We present evidence that the female becomes receptive and stops walking because she senses these vibrations, rather than as a response to air-borne songs produced by the male fluttering the wings [1, 2, 12]. We also present evidence that the neural circuits expressing the sex-determination genes fruitless and doublesex [8] drive quivering behavior. These abdominal quivers and associated vibrations, as well as their effect on female receptivity, are conserved in other Drosophila species. Substrate-borne vibrations are an ancient form of communication that is widespread in animals. Our findings in Drosophila open a door to study the neuromuscular circuitry responsible for these signals and the sensory systems needed for their reception. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The genetic program for sexual dimorphism has been a major focus of research in these two organisms almost from the moment they were chosen for study, and it may now be the best-understood general aspect of their development. In this review, we compare and contrast the strategies used for sex determination (including dosage compensation) between "the fly" and "the worm" and the way this understanding has come about. Although no overlap has been found among the molecules used by flies and worms to achieve sex determination, striking similarities have been found in the genetic strategies used by these two species to differentiate their sexes.},

abstract = {The fruitless (fru) gene of Drosophila produces both sex-specifically and non-sex-specifically spliced transcripts. Male-specific fru products are believed to regulate male courtship. To further an understanding of this gene's behavioral role, we examined the central nervous system (CNS) for temporal, spatial, and sexually dimorphic expression patterns of sex-specific fru products by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. For the latter, antibodies were designed to detect only male-specific forms of the protein (FRU(M)) or amino acid sequences that are in common among all translated products (FRU(COM)). Sex-specific mRNAs and male-specific proteins were first observed in mature larvae and peaked in their apparent abundances during the first half of the pupal period. At later stages and in adults, faint mRNA signals were seen in only a few neural clusters; in contrast, relatively strong FRU(M) signals persisted into adulthood. Twenty neuronal groups composed of 1700 fru-expressing neurons were identified in the midpupal CNS. These groups overlap most of the neural sites known to be involved in male courtship. Anti-FRU(COM) led to widespread labeling of neural and nonneural tissues in both sexes, but in the female CNS, only in developing ganglia in a pattern different from that of the male's FRU(M) cells. Expression of sex-specific fru mRNAs in the CNS of males analyzed from the earliest pupal stages indicated that sex-specific alternative splicing is not the exclusive mechanism regulating expression of fruitless transcripts.},

abstract = {Cre/LoxP recombination is the gold standard for conditional gene regulation in mice in vivo. However, promoters driving the expression of Cre recombinase are often active in a wide range of cell types and therefore unsuited to target more specific subsets of cells. To overcome this limitation, we designed inactive "split-Cre" fragments that regain Cre activity when overlapping co-expression is controlled by two different promoters. Using transgenic mice and virus-mediated expression of split-Cre, we show that efficient reporter gene activation is achieved in vivo. In the brain of transgenic mice, we genetically defined a subgroup of glial progenitor cells in which the Plp1- and the Gfap-promoter are simultaneously active, giving rise to both astrocytes and NG2-positive glia. Similarly, a subset of interneurons was labelled after viral transfection using Gad67- and Cck1 promoters to express split-Cre. Thus, split-Cre mediated genomic recombination constitutes a powerful spatial and temporal coincidence detector for in vivo targeting.},

abstract = {Recently, we identified neuregulin 1 (NRG1) as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia in the Icelandic population, by a combined linkage and association approach. Here, we report the first study evaluating the relevance of NRG1 to schizophrenia in a population outside Iceland. Markers representing a core at-risk haplotype found in Icelanders at the 5' end of the NRG1 gene were genotyped in 609 unrelated Scottish patients and 618 unrelated Scottish control individuals. This haplotype consisted of five SNP markers and two microsatellites, which all appear to be in strong linkage disequilibrium. For the Scottish patients and control subjects, haplotype frequencies were estimated by maximum likelihood, using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The frequency of the seven-marker haplotype among the Scottish patients was significantly greater than that among the control subjects (10.2{\%} vs. 5.9{\%}, P=.00031). The estimated risk ratio was 1.8, which is in keeping with our report of unrelated Icelandic patients (2.1). Three of the seven markers in the haplotype gave single-point P values ranging from .000064 to .0021 for the allele contributing to the at-risk haplotype. This direct replication of haplotype association in a second population further implicates NRG1 as a factor that contributes to the etiology of schizophrenia.},

The role of SIFamide in adult courtship behavior in both sexes was studied using two different approaches to perturb the function of SIFamide; targeted cell ablation and RNA interference (RNAi). Elimination of SIFamide by either of these methods results in promiscuous flies; males perform vigorous and indiscriminant courtship directed at either sex, while females appear sexually hyper-receptive. These results demonstrate that SIFamide is responsible for these behavioral effects and that the four SIFamidergic neurons and arborizations play an important function in the neuronal circuitry controlling Drosophila sexual behavior.},

abstract = {Genetically modified mice, lacking the GluA1 AMPA receptor subunit, are impaired on spatial working memory tasks, but display normal acquisition of spatial reference memory tasks. One explanation for this dissociation is that working memory, win-shift performance engages a GluA1-dependent, non-associative, short-term memory process through which animals choose relatively novel arms in preference to relatively familiar options. In contrast, spatial reference memory, as exemplified by the Morris water maze task, reflects a GluA1-independent, associative, long-term memory mechanism. These results can be accommodated by Wagner's dual-process model of memory in which short and long-term memory mechanisms exist in parallel and, under certain circumstances, compete with each other. According to our analysis, GluA1-/- mice lack short-term memory for recently experienced spatial stimuli. One consequence of this impairment is that these stimuli should remain surprising and thus be better able to form long-term associative representations. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have recently shown that long-term spatial memory for recently visited locations is enhanced in GluA1-/- mice, despite impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Taken together, these results support a role for GluA1-containing AMPA receptors in short-term habituation, and in modulating the intensity or perceived salience of stimuli. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Dendritic geometry has been shown to be a critical determinant of information processing and neuronal computation. However, it is not known whether cortical projection neurons that target different subcortical nuclei have distinct dendritic morphologies. In this study, fast blue retrograde tracing in combination with intracellular Lucifer yellow injection and diaminobenzidine (DAB) photoconversion in fixed slices was used to study the morphological features of corticospinal, corticostriatal, and corticothalamic neurons in layer V of rat motor cortex. Marked differences in the distribution of soma, somal size, and dendritic profiles were found among the three groups of pyramidal neurons. Corticospinal neurons were large, were located in deep layer V, and had the most expansive dendritic fields. The apical dendrites of corticospinal pyramidal neurons were thick, spiny, and branched. In contrast, nearly all corticostriatal neurons were small cells located in superficial layer V. Their apical dendritic shafts were significantly more slender, though spiny like those of corticospinal neurons. Corticothalamic neurons, which were located in superficial layer V and in layer VI, had small or medium-sized soma, slender apical dendritic shafts, and dendrites that were largely spine free. This study indicates that, in layer V of rat motor cortex, each population of projection neurons has a unique somatodendritic morphology and suggests that distinct modes of cortical information processing are operative in corticospinal, corticostriatal, and corticothalamic neurons.},

How the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear are encoded within CEA inhibitory circuits is not understood. Using in vivo electrophysiological, optogenetic and pharmacological approaches in mice, we show that neuronal activity in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala (CEl) is required for fear acquisition, whereas conditioned fear responses are driven by output neurons in the medial subdivision (CEm). Functional circuit analysis revealed that inhibitory CEA microcircuits are highly organized and that cell-type-specific plasticity of phasic and tonic activity in the CEl to CEm pathway may gate fear expression and regulate fear generalization. Our results define the functional architecture of CEA microcircuits and their role in the acquisition and regulation of conditioned fear behaviour.},

In experiment 1, mCry1(-/-) and mCry2(-/-) mice as well as mPer1(Brdm1) and mPer2(Brdm1) mutant mice were exposed to 15-min light pulses during the 1st cycle following entrainment, either early (external time [ExT] 20) or late (ExT 4) in the subjective night. In experiment 2, a full PRC was measured for all these strains by exposure to light pulses of the same duration and intensity in free-running conditions in constant darkness. Directly after entrainment (experiment 1), mPer1(Brdm1) animals did not show significant phase advances by a light pulse in the late subjective night (ExT 4), as in the study by Albrecht et al. In the same experiment, mPer2(Brdm1) mice became arrhythmic too frequently to reliably measure their phase responses. Mice with a targeted gene disruption in mCry1 or mCry2 showed increased phase delays compared to wild type after exposure to a light pulse in the early subjective night (ExT 20). Otherwise, phase shifts were not significantly affected. In free run (experiment 2), all genotypes did show phase advances and phase delays. The mPer2(Brdm1) mutant PRC was above the mPer1(Brdm1) mutant and wild-type PRC (i.e., less delayed and more advanced) at most circadian phases. The mPer1(Brdm1) mutant PRC was not distinguishable from the wildtype PRC. The mCry2(-/-) mice showed much smaller phase delays than did mCry1(-/-) mice in the subjective evening (delay phase). In general, mPer2(Brdm1) mutant mice were more accelerated by light compared to mPer1(Brdm1) and wildtype control mice, whereas mCry1(-/-) mice were more delayed by light than were mCry2(-/-) mice.},

abstract = {The ability of central glutamatergic synapses to change their strength in response to the intensity of synaptic input, which occurs, for example, in long-term potentiation (LTP), is thought to provide a cellular basis for memory formation and learning. LTP in the CA1 field of the hippocampus requires activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-kinase II (CaM-KII), which phosphorylates Ser-831 in the GluR1 subunit of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate glutamate receptor (AMPA-R), and this activation/phosphorylation is thought to be a postsynaptic mechanism in LTP. In this study, we have identified a molecular mechanism by which CaM-KII potentiates AMPA-Rs. Coexpression in HEK-293 cells of activated CaM-KII with GluR1 did not affect the glutamate affinity of the receptor, the kinetics of desensitization and recovery, channel rectification, open probability, or gating. Single-channel recordings identified multiple conductance states for GluR1, and coexpression with CaM-KII or a mutation of Ser-831 to Asp increased the contribution of the higher conductance states. These results indicate that CaM-KII can mediate plasticity at glutamatergic synapses by increasing single-channel conductance of existing functional AMPA-Rs or by recruiting new high-conductance-state AMPA-Rs.},

Here, we review recent electrophysiological studies indicating that neurons in the lateral amygdala encode aversive memories during the acquisition and extinction of Pavlovian fear conditioning. Studies that combine unit recording with brain lesions and pharmacological inactivation provide evidence that the lateral amygdala is a crucial locus of fear memory. Extinction of fear memory reduces associative plasticity in the lateral amygdala and involves the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Understanding the signalling of aversive memory by amygdala neurons opens new avenues for research into the neural systems that support fear behaviour.},

EMDPL is used to map phase synchronization levels between all channel pair combinations in the EEG. This results in complex networks of channel connectivity at all timefrequency locations. The mean clustering coefficient is then used as a descriptive feature encapsulating information about inter-channel connectivity. Hidden Markov models are applied to characterize and classify dynamics of the resulting complex networks. Highly accurate levels of classification are achieved when this technique is applied to classify EEG recorded during real and imagined single finger taps. These results are compared to traditional features used in the classification of a finger tap BCI demonstrating that functional connectivity dynamics provide additional information and improved BCI control accuracies. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {GABAergic interneurons play key roles in cortical circuits, yet little is known about their early connectivity. Here we use glutamate uncaging and a novel optogenetic strategy to track changes in the afferent and efferent synaptic connections of developing neocortical interneuron subtypes. We find that Nkx2-1-derived interneurons possess functional synaptic connections before emerging pyramidal cell networks. Subsequent interneuron circuit maturation is both subtype and layer dependent. Glutamatergic input onto fast spiking (FS), but not somatostatin-positive, non-FS interneurons increases over development. Interneurons of both subtype located in layers (L) 4 and 5b engage in transient circuits that disappear after the somatosensory critical period. These include a pathway mediated by L5b somatostatin-positive interneurons that specifically targets L4 during the first postnatal week. The innervation patterns of immature cortical interneuron circuits are thus neither static nor progressively strengthened but follow a layer-specific choreography of transient connections that differ from those of the adult brain.},

abstract = {Animals consolidate some, but not all, learning experiences into long-term memory. Across the animal kingdom, sleep has been found to have a beneficial effect on the consolidation of recently formed memories into long-term storage. However, the underlying mechanisms of sleep dependent memory consolidation are poorly understood. Here, we show that consolidation of courtship long-term memory in Drosophila is mediated by reactivation during sleep of dopaminergic neurons that were earlier involved in memory acquisition. We identify specific fan-shaped body neurons that induce sleep after the learning experience and activate dopaminergic neurons for memory consolidation. Thus, we provide a direct link between sleep, neuronal reactivation of dopaminergic neurons, and memory consolidation.Why do some memories fade after only a few seconds, whereas others last a lifetime? Studies suggest that part of the explanation has to do with sleep. Experiments in rodents show that neural circuits that are active during learning become active again when an animal sleeps. This process of reactivation, which may be akin to dreaming, helps strengthen specific memories and move them into long-term storage. But the complexity of the mammalian brain has made it difficult to pin down the underlying mechanisms.One possible solution is to study the mechanisms in a simpler brain with fewer neurons, such as that of the fruit fly Drosophila. Dag, Lei et al. have now used molecular genetic tools to explore how sleep supports a specific type of learning in male fruit flies, called courtship learning. Female fruit flies that have recently mated will reject the courtship efforts of other males. A male fly that experiences repeated rejections therefore learns to avoid mated females in future. This type of memory can last for at least a day – a long time in the life of a fly.Dag, Lei et al. show that males that experience repeated rejections subsequently spend more time asleep than control males. Preventing this sleep hinders the males from learning from their experience. But how does this process work? During sleep, specific dopamine neurons that were active during the learning episode become active once again. Blocking this reactivation prevents the flies from learning from their rejections. By contrast, artificially activating the dopamine neurons enables flies with only limited experience of rejection to learn to avoid mated females. Dag, Lei et al. show that neurons called vFB cells control this process. The vFB neurons both induce sleep and reactivate the memory-inducing dopamine neurons.These findings in fruit flies thus reveal a direct causal link between sleep, reactivation of memory traces, and persistence of memories. They also show that fruit flies are a valid model for exploring the neural and molecular mechanisms connecting sleep and long-term memory.},

Visual experience, however, is a subset of a more general requirement for neural activity in transforming immature circuits into the organized connections that subserve adult brain function. Early in development, internally generated spontaneous activity sculpts circuits on the basis of the brain's "best guess" at the initial configuration of connections necessary for function and survival. With maturation of the sense organs, the developing brain relies less on spontaneous activity and increasingly on sensory experience. The sequential combination of spontaneously generated and experience-dependent neural activity endows the brain with an ongoing ability to accommodate to dynamically changing inputs during development and throughout life.},

To overcome these limitations, we developed a chronic in vivo recording and stimulation platform based on flexible mesh electronics, and we demonstrated stable multiplexed local field potentials and single-unit recordings in mouse brains for at least 8 months without probe repositioning. Properties of acquired signals suggest robust tracking of the same neurons over this period. This recording and stimulation platform allowed us to evoke stable single-neuron responses to chronic electrical stimulation and to carry out longitudinal studies of brain aging in freely behaving mice. Such advantages could open up future studies in mapping and modulating changes associated with learning, aging and neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Comparisons of rhythmic movements and the central pattern generators (CPGs) that control them uncover principles about the evolution of behaviour and neural circuits. Over the course of evolutionary history, gradual evolution of behaviours and their neural circuitry within any lineage of animals has been a predominant occurrence. Small changes in gene regulation can lead to divergence of circuit organization and corresponding changes in behaviour. However, some behavioural divergence has resulted from large-scale rewiring of the neural network. Divergence of CPG circuits has also occurred without a corresponding change in behaviour. When analogous rhythmic behaviours have evolved independently, it has generally been with different neural mechanisms. Repeated evolution of particular rhythmic behaviours has occurred within some lineages due to parallel evolution or latent CPGs. Particular motor pattern generating mechanisms have also evolved independently in separate lineages. The evolution of CPGs and rhythmic behaviours shows that although most behaviours and neural circuits are highly conserved, the nature of the behaviour does not dictate the neural mechanism and that the presence of homologous neural components does not determine the behaviour. This suggests that although behaviour is generated by neural circuits, natural selection can act separately on these two levels of biological organization.},

Here we show that ipRGCs consist of distinct subpopulations that differentially express the Brn3b transcription factor, and can be functionally distinguished. Brn3b-negative M1 ipRGCs innervate the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, whereas Brn3b-positive ipRGCs innervate all other known brain targets, including the olivary pretectal nucleus. Consistent with these innervation patterns, selective ablation of Brn3b-positive ipRGCs severely disrupts the PLR, but does not impair circadian photoentrainment. Thus, we find that molecularly distinct subpopulations of M1 ipRGCs, which are morphologically and electrophysiologically similar, innervate different brain regions to execute specific light-induced functions.},

Here, we trained mice to switch between two contexts: passively listening to pure tones and performing a recognition task for the same stimuli. Two-photon imaging showed that many excitatory neurons in auditory cortex were suppressed during behavior, while some cells became more active. Whole-cell recordings showed that excitatory inputs were affected only modestly by context, but inhibition was more sensitive, with PV(+), SOM(+), and VIP(+) interneurons balancing inhibition and disinhibition within the network. Cholinergic modulation was involved in context switching, with cholinergic axons increasing activity during behavior and directly depolarizing inhibitory cells. Network modeling captured these findings, but only when modulation coincidently drove all three interneuron subtypes, ruling out either inhibition or disinhibition alone as sole mechanism for active engagement. Parallel processing of cholinergic modulation by cortical interneurons therefore enables context-dependent behavior.},

abstract = {Important insights into the selection pressures and core molecular modules contributing to the evolution of pain-related processes have come from studies of nociceptive systems in several molluscan and arthropod species. These phyla, and the chordates that include humans, last shared a common ancestor approximately 550 million years ago. Since then, animals in these phyla have continued to be subject to traumatic injury, often from predators, which has led to similar adaptive behaviors (e.g., withdrawal, escape, recuperative behavior) and physiological responses to injury in each group. Comparisons across these taxa provide clues about the contributions of convergent evolution and of conservation of ancient adaptive mechanisms to general nociceptive and pain-related functions. Primary nociceptors have been investigated extensively in a few molluscan and arthropod species, with studies of long-lasting nociceptive sensitization in the gastropod, Aplysia, and the insect, Drosophila, being especially fruitful. In Aplysia, nociceptive sensitization has been investigated as a model for aversive memory and for hyperalgesia. Neuromodulator-induced, activity-dependent, and axotomy-induced plasticity mechanisms have been defined in synapses, cell bodies, and axons of Aplysia primary nociceptors. Studies of nociceptive sensitization in Drosophila larvae have revealed numerous molecular contributors in primary nociceptors and interacting cells. Interestingly, molecular contributors examined thus far in Aplysia and Drosophila are largely different, but both sets overlap extensively with those in mammalian pain-related pathways. In contrast to results from Aplysia and Drosophila, nociceptive sensitization examined in moth larvae (Manduca) disclosed central hyperactivity but no obvious peripheral sensitization of nociceptive responses. Squid (Doryteuthis) show injury-induced sensitization manifested as behavioral hypersensitivity to tactile and especially visual stimuli, and as hypersensitivity and spontaneous activity in nociceptor terminals. Temporary blockade of nociceptor activity during injury subsequently increased mortality when injured squid were exposed to fish predators, providing the first demonstration in any animal of the adaptiveness of nociceptive sensitization. Immediate responses to noxious stimulation and nociceptive sensitization have also been examined behaviorally and physiologically in a snail (Helix), octopus (Adopus), crayfish (Astacus), hermit crab (Pagurus), and shore crab (Hemigrapsus). Molluscs and arthropods have systems that suppress nociceptive responses, but whether opioid systems play antinociceptive roles in these phyla is uncertain.},

Early third-instar larvae prefer 24°C, which switches to increasingly stronger biases for 18°C–19°C in mid- and late-third-instar larvae. Mutations eliminating either of two rhodopsins, Rh5 and Rh6, wiped out these age-dependent changes in thermal preference. In larvae, Rh5 and Rh6 are thought to function exclusively in the light-sensing Bolwig organ. However, the Bolwig organ was dispensable for the thermal preference. Rather, Rh5 and Rh6 were required in trpA1-expressing neurons in the brain, ventral nerve cord, and body wall. Because Rh1 contributes to thermal selection in the comfortable range during the early to mid-third-instar stage, fine thermal discrimination depends on multiple rhodopsins.},

abstract = {Cooperation among non-kin has been attributed sometimes to reciprocal altruism: Two or more individuals exchange behaviour that benefits the respective partner. According to direct reciprocity, cooperation is based on past behaviour of a known partner. In contrast, in generalised reciprocity, cooperation is based on anonymous social experience where the identity of the partner is irrelevant. In a previous study, female Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) were found to cooperate according to a generalised reciprocity mechanism. In this study, we tested whether Norway rats would also cooperate as predicted by a direct reciprocity mechanism and whether direct reciprocity would cause a higher propensity to cooperate than generalised reciprocity. Focal animals were experimentally manipulated to receive social experience from known or unknown, helpful or defecting partners in an instrumental cooperative task. Our first experiment shows that rats are more helpful towards a partner from which they had received help before than towards a partner that had not helped (i.e. direct reciprocity). Our second experiment revealed that after receiving help by others, rats were more helpful towards a partner from which they had received help before than towards a new partner (i.e. direct reciprocity generated a higher cooperation propensity than generalised reciprocity). We conclude that in female Nor way rats, the tendency to cooperate is influenced by partner-specific information. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate direct reciprocity in rodents, and it is the first study testing direct vs generalised reciprocity in animals.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate fast corticosteroid feedback of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis under basal conditions, in particular the role of the mineralocorticoid receptor. Blood samples were collected every 5 min from conscious rats at the diurnal peak, using an automated blood sampling system, and assayed for corticosterone. Feedback inhibition by rapidly increasing concentrations of ligand was achieved with an intravenous bolus of exogenous corticosteroid. This resulted in a significant reduction in plasma corticosterone concentrations within 23 min of the aldosterone bolus and 28 min of methylprednisolone. Evaluation of the pulsatile secretion of corticosterone revealed that the secretory event in progress at the time of administration of exogenous steroid was unaffected, whereas the next secretory event was inhibited by both aldosterone and methylprednisolone. The inhibitory effect of aldosterone was limited in duration (1 secretory event only), whereas that of methylprednisolone persisted for 4-5 h. Intravenous administration of canrenoate (a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) also had rapid effects on the HPA axis, with an elevation of ACTH within 10 min and corticosterone within 20 min. The inhibitory effect of aldosterone was unaffected by pretreatment with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-38486 but blocked by the canrenoate. These data imply an important role for the mineralocorticoid receptor in fast feedback of basal HPA activity and suggest that mineralocorticoids can dynamically regulate basal corticosterone concentrations during the diurnal peak, a time of day when there is already a high level of occupancy of the cytoplasmic mineralocorticoid receptor.},

abstract = {The fruitless (fru) gene in Drosophila melanogaster is a multifunctional gene that has sex-specific functions in the regulation of male sexual behavior and sex-nonspecific functions affecting adult viability and external morphology. While much attention has focused on fru's sex-specific roles, less is known about its sex-nonspecific functions. We have examined fru's sex-nonspecific role in embryonic neural development. fru transcripts from sex-nonspecific promoters are expressed beginning at the earliest stages of neurogenesis, and Fru proteins are present in both neurons and glia. In embryos that lack most or all fru function, FasII- and BP102-positive axons have defasciculation defects and grow along abnormal pathways in the CNS. These defects in axonal projections in fru mutants were rescued by the expression of specific UAS-fru transgenes under the control of a pan-neuronal scabrous-GAL4 driver. Our results suggest that one of fru's sex-nonspecific roles is to regulate the pathfinding ability of axons in the embryonic CNS.},

abstract = {Electrical stimulation of axons in the hippocampus with short high-frequency bursts that resemble in vivo activity patterns produces stable potentiation of postsynaptic responses when the bursts occur at intervals of 200 milliseconds but not 2 seconds. When a burst was applied to one input and a second burst applied to a different input to the same target neuron 200 milliseconds later, only the synapses activated by the second burst showed stable potentiation. This effect was observed even when the two inputs innervated completely Werent regions of the postsynaptic cells; but did not occur when the inputs were stimulated simultaneously or when the second burst was delayed by 2 seconds. Intracellular recordings indicated that the first burst extended the decay phase of excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked 200 milliseconds later. These results suggest that a single burst of axonal stimulation produces a transient, spatially diffuse "priming" effect that prolongs responses to subsequent bursts, and that these altered responses trigger spatially restricted synaptic modifications. The similarity of the temporal parameters of the priming effect and the theta rhythm that dominates the hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG) during learning episodes suggests that this priming may be involved in behaviorally induced synaptic plasticity},

A light pulse can evoke a change in the onset of wheel-running activity in mice by shifting the onset of activity to earlier times (phase advance) or later times (phase delays) thereby advancing or delaying the clock (clock resetting). To assess the role of mouse Per (mPer) genes in circadian clock resetting, mice carrying mutant mPer1 or mPer2 genes were tested for responses to a light pulse at ZT 14 and ZT 22, respectively. The authors found that mPer1 mutants did not advance and mPer2 mutants did not delay the clock.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Benzodiazepines are the most frequently used drug for the treatment of insomnia. Prolonged use of benzodiazepine therapy is not recommended. However, many patients, particularly older patients, have difficulties discontinuing therapy. Melatonin, a hormone that is produced at night by the pineal gland, promotes normal sleep in humans and augments sleep induction by benzodiazepine therapy. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the administration of melatonin could facilitate the discontinuation of benzodiazepine therapy in patients with insomnia. METHODS: Thirty-four subjects receiving benzodiazepine therapy were enrolled in the 2-period study. In period 1, patients received (double-blinded) melatonin (2 mg in a controlled-release formulation) or a placebo nightly for 6 weeks. They were encouraged to reduce their benzodiazepine dosage 50{\%} during week 2, 75{\%} during weeks 3 and 4, and to discontinue benzodiazepine therapy completely during weeks 5 and 6. In period 2, melatonin was administered (single-blinded) for 6 weeks to all subjects and attempts to discontinue benzodiazepine therapy were resumed. Benzodiazepine consumption and subjective sleep-quality scores were reported daily by all patients. All subjects were then allowed to continue melatonin therapy and follow-up reassessments were performed 6 months later. RESULTS: By the end of period 1, 14 of 18 subjects who had received melatonin therapy, but only 4 of 16 in the placebo group, discontinued benzodiazepine therapy (P = .006). Sleep-quality scores were significantly higher in the melatonin therapy group (P = .04). Six additional subjects in the placebo group discontinued benzodiazepine therapy when given melatonin in period 2. The 6-month follow-up assessments revealed that of the 24 patients who discontinued benzodiazepine and received melatonin therapy, 19 maintained good sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Controlled-release melatonin may effectively facilitate discontinuation of benzodiazepine therapy while maintaining good sleep quality.},

Here we developed a tetrahydrofuran-based clearing procedure that renders fixed and unsectioned adult CNS tissue transparent and fully penetrable for optical imaging. In large spinal cord segments, we imaged fluorescently labeled cells by 'ultramicroscopy' and two-photon microscopy without the need for histological sectioning. We found that more than a year after injury growth-competent axons regenerated abundantly through the injury site. A few growth-incompetent axons could also regenerate when they bypassed the lesion. Moreover, we accurately determined quantitative changes of glial cells after spinal cord injury. Thus, clearing CNS tissue enables an unambiguous evaluation of axon regeneration and glial reactions. Our clearing procedure also renders other organs transparent, which makes this approach useful for a large number of preclinical paradigms.},

Here, we used intersectional genetic manipulations to identify these critical components of pain transduction. Marking and ablating six populations of spinal excitatory and inhibitory neurons, coupled with behavioral and electrophysiological analysis, showed that excitatory neurons expressing somatostatin (SOM) include T-type cells, whose ablation causes loss of mechanical pain. Inhibitory neurons marked by the expression of dynorphin (Dyn) represent INs, which are necessary to gate A?? fibers from activating SOM+ neurons to evoke pain. Therefore, peripheral mechanical nociceptors and A?? mechanoreceptors, together with spinal SOM+ excitatory and Dyn+ inhibitory neurons, form a microcircuit that transmits and gates mechanical pain.

Here, we identify an ipsilaterally projecting excitatory interneuron population, marked by the expression of Shox2 that overlaps partially with V2a interneurons. Optogenetic silencing or blocking synaptic output of Shox2 interneurons (INs) in transgenic mice perturbed rhythm without an effect on pattern generation, whereas ablation of the Shox2 IN subset coinciding with the V2a population was without effect. Most Shox2 INs are rhythmically active during locomotion and analysis of synaptic connectivity showed that Shox2 INs contact other Shox2 INs, commissural neurons, and motor neurons,with preference for flexor motor neurons. Our findings focus attention on a subset of Shox2 INs that appearto participate in the rhythm-generating kernel for spinal locomotion},

abstract = {Lamina I of the spinal cord is densely innervated by nociceptive primary afferents, many of which contain substance P. It contains numerous projection neurons: the majority of these respond to noxious stimuli, however some are activated by cooling. In the rat, approximately 80{\%} of the projection neurons express the neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor, on which substance P acts, and most cells with this receptor are activated by noxious stimuli. Lamina I neurons can be classified morphologically into pyramidal, multipolar, and fusiform types. It has been reported in the cat that pyramidal neurons are activated only by cooling and that in monkey relatively few pyramidal cells are NK1 receptor-immunoreactive. We have used immunocytochemistry to examine the innervation of lamina I projection neurons in the rat by substance P-containing primary afferents and their responses to a noxious stimulus (subcutaneous formalin injection). NK1 receptor-immunoreactive projection cells received a significantly higher density of contacts from substance P-containing afferents than neurons that lacked the receptor. Most contacts on NK1 receptor-immunoreactive cells were associated with synapses. Formalin injection induced c-Fos in approximately 80{\%} of projection neurons with the NK1 receptor and in 25-45{\%} of those without it. More than 80{\%} of pyramidal neurons expressed the receptor, and for both substance P innervation and c-Fos expression there were no significant differences among different morphological types of NK1 receptor-immunoreactive neuron. We conclude that presence or absence of the NK1 receptor is a better indicator of function than morphology for lamina I projection neurons in the rat.},

To evaluate whether the alterations in gene expression in cocaine overdose victims are associated with specific dopamine populations in the midbrain, cDNA arrays and western blotting were used to compare gene and protein expression patterns between cocaine overdose victims and age-matched controls in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and lateral substantia nigra (l-SN). Array analysis revealed significant up-regulation of numerous transcripts in the VTA, but not in the l-SN, of cocaine overdose victims including NMDAR1, GluR2, GluR5 and KA2 receptor mRNA (p {\textless} 0.05). No significant alterations between overdose victims and controls were observed for GluR1, R3 or R4 mRNA levels. Correspondingly, western blot analysis revealed VTA-selective up-regulation of CREB (p {\textless} 0.01), NMDAR1 (p {\textless} 0.01), GluR2 (p {\textless} 0.05), GluR5 (p {\textless} 0.01) and KA2 (p {\textless} 0.05) protein levels of cocaine overdose victims. The present results indicate that selective alterations of CREB and certain ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) subtypes appear to be associated with chronic cocaine use in humans in a region-specific manner. Moreover, as subunit composition determines the functional properties of iGluRs, the observed changes may indicate alterations in the excitability of dopamine transmission underlying long-term biochemical and behavioral effects of cocaine in humans.},

The sustained entry of Ca2+ is thought to result partly from the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ pools. Most investigations have characterized Ca2+ influx indirectly by measuring Ca(2+)-activated currents or using Fura-2 quenching by Mn2+, which in some cells enters the cells by the same influx pathway. But only a few studies have investigated this Ca2+ entry pathway more directly. We have combined patch-clamp and Fura-2 measurements to monitor membrane currents in mast cells under conditions where intracellular Ca2+ stores were emptied by either inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, ionomycin, or excess of the Ca2+ chelator EGTA. The depletion of Ca2+ pools by these independent mechanisms commonly induced activation of a sustained calcium inward current that was highly selective for Ca2+ ions over Ba2+, Sr2+ and Mn2+. This Ca2+ current, which we term ICRAC (calcium release-activated calcium), is not voltage-activated and shows a characteristic inward rectification. It may be the mechanism by which electrically nonexcitable cells maintain raised intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and replenish their empty Ca2+ stores after receptor stimulation.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity causes the rapid expression of immediate early genes that are crucial for experience-driven changes to synapses, learning, and memory. Here, using both molecular and genome-wide next-generation sequencing methods, we report that neuronal activity stimulation triggers the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in the promoters of a subset of early-response genes, including Fos, Npas4, and Egr1. Generation of targeted DNA DSBs within Fos and Npas4 promoters is sufficient to induce their expression even in the absence of an external stimulus. Activity-dependent DSB formation is likely mediated by the type II topoisomerase, Topoisomerase II?? (Topo II??), and knockdown of Topo II?? attenuates both DSB formation and early-response gene expression following neuronal stimulation. Our results suggest that DSB formation is a physiological event that rapidly resolves topological constraints to early-response gene expression in neurons. PaperClip},

abstract = {Growing axons are exposed to various guidance cues en route to their targets. Although many guidance molecules have been identified and their effects on axon behavior extensively studied, how axons react to combinations of signals remains largely unexplored. We review recent studies investigating the combined actions of guidance cues present at the same choice points. Two main scenarios are emerging from these studies: parallel signaling and crosstalk between guidance systems. In the first case, cues act in an additive manner, whereas in the second case the outcome is non-additive and differs from the sum of individual effects, suggesting more complex signal integration in the growth cone. Some of the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions are beginning to be unraveled. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The avoidance of light by fly larvae is a classic paradigm for sensorimotor behavior. Here, we use behavioral assays and video microscopy to quantify the sensorimotor structure of phototaxis using the Drosophila larva. Larval locomotion is composed of sequences of runs (periods of forward movement) that are interrupted by abrupt turns, during which the larva pauses and sweeps its head back and forth, probing local light information to determine the direction of the successive run. All phototactic responses are mediated by the same set of sensorimotor transformations that require temporal processing of sensory inputs. Through functional imaging and genetic inactivation of specific neurons downstream of the sensory periphery, we have begun to map these sensorimotor circuits into the larval central brain. We find that specific sensorimotor pathways that govern distinct light-evoked responses begin to segregate at the first relay after the photosensory neurons.},

abstract = {Synaptic plasticity dependent on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is thought to underlie certain types of learning and memory. In support of this, both hippocampal long-term potentiation and spatial learning in a watermaze are impaired by blocking NMDA receptors with a selective antagonist D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP5) or by a mutation in one of the receptor subunits. Here we report, however, that the AP5-induced learning deficit can be almost completely prevented if rats are pretrained in a different watermaze before administration of the drug. This is not because of stimulus generalization, and occurs despite learning of the second task remaining hippocampus dependent. An AP5-induced learning deficit is, however, still seen if the animals are pretrained using a non-spatial task. Thus, despite its procedural simplicity, the watermaze may involve multiple cognitive processes with distinct pharmacological properties; although required for some component of spatial learning, NMDA receptors may not be required for encoding the spatial representation of a specific environment.},

Here, we present the first fiber-less optoelectrode with a monolithically integrated optical waveguide mixer that can deliver multicolor light at a common waveguide port to achieve multicolor modulation of the same neuronal population in vivo. We demonstrate successful device implementation by achieving efficient coupling between a side-emitting injection laser diode (ILD) and a dielectric optical waveguide mixer via a gradient-index (GRIN) lens. The use of GRIN lenses attains several design features, including high optical coupling and thermal isolation between ILDs and waveguides. We validated the packaged devices in the intact brain of anesthetized mice co-expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 and Archaerhodopsin in pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region, achieving high quality recording, activation and silencing of the exact same neurons in a given local region. This fully-integrated approach demonstrates the spatial precision and scalability needed to enable independent activation and silencing of the same or different groups of neurons in dense brain regions while simultaneously recording from them, thus considerably advancing the capabilities of currently available optogenetic toolsets.},

abstract = {Interneurons of the cerebral cortex represent a heterogeneous population of cells with important roles in network function. At present, little is known about how these neurons are specified in the developing telencephalon. To explore whether this diversity is established in the early progenitor populations, we conducted in utero fate-mapping of the mouse medial and caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE and CGE, respectively), from which most cortical interneurons arise. Mature interneuron subtypes were assessed by electrophysiological and immunological analysis, as well as by morphological reconstruction. At E13.5, the MGE gives rise to fast-spiking (FS) interneurons, whereas the CGE generates predominantly regular-spiking interneurons (RSNP). Later at E15.5, the CGE produces RSNP classes distinct from those generated from the E13.5 CGE. Thus, we provide evidence that the spatial and temporal origin of interneuron precursors in the developing telencephalic eminences predicts the intrinsic physiological properties of mature interneurons.

abstract = {All forms of locomotion are repetitive motor activities that require coordinated bilateral activation of muscles. The executive elements of locomotor control are networks of spinal neurons that determine gait pattern through the sequential activation of motor-neuron pools on either side of the body axis. However, little is known about the constraints that link left-right coordination to locomotor speed. Recent advances have indicated that both excitatory and inhibitory commissural neurons may be involved in left-right coordination. But the neural underpinnings of this, and a possible causal link between these different groups of commissural neurons and left-right alternation, are lacking. Here we show, using intersectional mouse genetics, that ablation of a group of transcriptionally defined commissural neurons--the V0 population--leads to a quadrupedal hopping at all frequencies of locomotion. The selective ablation of inhibitory V0 neurons leads to a lack of left-right pattern at low frequencies, mixed coordination at medium frequencies, and alternation at high locomotor frequencies. When ablation is targeted to excitatory V0 neurons, left-right alternation is present at low frequencies, and hopping is restricted to medium and high locomotor frequencies. Therefore, the intrinsic logic of the central control of locomotion incorporates a modular organization, with two subgroups of V0 neurons required for the existence of left-right alternating modes at different speeds of locomotion. The two molecularly distinct sets of commissural neurons may constrain species-related naturally occurring frequency-dependent coordination and be involved in the evolution of different gaits.},

abstract = {Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons in the brain's reward circuit have a crucial role in mediating stress responses, including determining susceptibility versus resilience to social-stress-induced behavioural abnormalities. VTA dopamine neurons show two in vivo patterns of firing: low frequency tonic firing and high frequency phasic firing. Phasic firing of the neurons, which is well known to encode reward signals, is upregulated by repeated social-defeat stress, a highly validated mouse model of depression. Surprisingly, this pathophysiological effect is seen in susceptible mice only, with no apparent change in firing rate in resilient individuals. However, direct evidence--in real time--linking dopamine neuron phasic firing in promoting the susceptible (depression-like) phenotype is lacking. Here we took advantage of the temporal precision and cell-type and projection-pathway specificity of optogenetics to show that enhanced phasic firing of these neurons mediates susceptibility to social-defeat stress in freely behaving mice. We show that optogenetic induction of phasic, but not tonic, firing in VTA dopamine neurons of mice undergoing a subthreshold social-defeat paradigm rapidly induced a susceptible phenotype as measured by social avoidance and decreased sucrose preference. Optogenetic phasic stimulation of these neurons also quickly induced a susceptible phenotype in previously resilient mice that had been subjected to repeated social-defeat stress. Furthermore, we show differences in projection-pathway specificity in promoting stress susceptibility: phasic activation of VTA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), induced susceptibility to social-defeat stress. Conversely, optogenetic inhibition of the VTA-NAc projection induced resilience, whereas inhibition of the VTA-mPFC projection promoted susceptibility. Overall, these studies reveal novel firing-pattern- and neural-circuit-specific mechanisms of depression.},

abstract = {The transduction of taste is a fundamental process that allows animals to discriminate nutritious from noxious substances. Three taste modalities, bitter, sweet, and amino acid, are mediated by G protein-coupled receptors that signal through a common transduction cascade: activation of phospholipase C beta2, leading to a breakdown of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which causes release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. The ion channel, TRPM5, is an essential component of this cascade; however, the mechanism by which it is activated is not known. Here we show that heterologously expressed TRPM5 forms a cation channel that is directly activated by micromolar concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ (K1/2 = 21 microM). Sustained exposure to Ca2+ desensitizes TRPM5 channels, but PIP2 reverses desensitization, partially restoring channel activity. Whole-cell TRPM5 currents can be activated by intracellular Ca2+ and show strong outward rectification because of voltage-sensitive gating of the channels. TRPM5 channels are nonselective among monovalent cations and not detectably permeable to divalent cations. We propose that the regulation of TRPM5 by Ca2+ mediates sensory activation in the taste system.},

abstract = {Recent work has shown that the hippocampus contains a class of receptors for the excitatory amino acid glutamate that are activated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and that exhibit a peculiar dependency on membrane voltage in becoming active only on depolarization. Blockade of these sites with the drug aminophosphonovaleric acid (AP5) does not detectably affect synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, but prevents the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) following brief high-frequency stimulation. We now report that chronic intraventricular infusion of D,L-AP5 causes a selective impairment of place learning, which is highly sensitive to hippocampal damage, without affecting visual discrimination learning, which is not. The L-isomer of AP5 did not produce behavioural effects. AP5 treatment also suppressed LTP in vivo. These results suggest that NMDA receptors are involved in spatial learning, and add support to the hypothesis that LTP is involved in some, but not all, forms of learning.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1964-2012 IEEE. In vivo whole-body imaging of small animals plays an important role for biomedical studies. In particular, animals like the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster or the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans are popular model organisms for preclinical research since they offer sophisticated genetic tool-kits. Recording these translucent animals with high contrast in a large arena is however not trivial. Furthermore, fluorescent proteins are widely used to mark cells in vivo and report their functions. This paper introduces a novel optical imaging technique called FIM 2c  enabling simultaneous detection of the animals posture and movement as well as fluorescent markers like green fluorescent protein (GFP). FIM 2c  utilizes frustrated total internal reflection of two distinct wavelengths and captures both, reflected and emitted light. The resultant two-color high-contrast images are superb compared to other imaging systems for larvae or worms. This multipurpose method enables a large variety of different experimental approaches. For example, FIM 2c can be used to image GFP positive cells/tissues/animals and supports the integration of fluorescent tracers into multitarget tracking paradigms. Moreover, optogenetic tools can be applied in large-scale behavioral analysis to manipulate and study neuronal functions. To demonstrate the benefit of our system, we use FIM 2c  to resolve colliding larvae in a high-Throughput approach, which was impossible given the existing tools. Finally, we present a comprehensive database including images and locomotion features of more than 1300 resolved collisions available for the community. In conclusion, FIM 2c  is a versatile tool for advanced imaging and locomotion analysis for a variety of different model organisms.},

This includes voltage-gated channels, as well as background (or leak) channels that collectively regulate resting membrane potential and action potential firing properties. Dysregulated ion channel expression in response to nerve injury and inflammation results in enhanced neuronal excitability that underlies chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain. Pharmacological modulators of ion channels, particularly those that target channels on peripheral neurons, are being pursued as possible analgesics. Over the past few years, a number of different types of ion channels have been implicated in afferent pain signaling. Here we give an overview of recent advances on sodium, calcium, potassium and chloride channels that are emerging as especially attractive targets for the treatment of pain.},

Unique features of this meta-analytic review include (a) more restrictive methodological quality inclusion criteria than in past meta-analyses; (b) cross-cultural comparisons; (c) longitudinal studies for all outcomes except physiological arousal; (d) conservative statistical controls; (e) multiple moderator analyses; and (f) sensitivity analyses. Social-cognitive models and cultural differences between Japan and Western countries were used to generate theory-based predictions. Meta-analyses yielded significant effects for all 6 outcome variables. The pattern of results for different outcomes and research designs (experimental, cross-sectional, longitudinal) fit theoretical predictions well. The evidence strongly suggests that exposure to violent video games is a causal risk factor for increased aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect and for decreased empathy and prosocial behavior. Moderator analyses revealed significant research design effects, weak evidence of cultural differences in susceptibility and type of measurement effects, and no evidence of sex differences in susceptibility. Results of various sensitivity analyses revealed these effects to be robust, with little evidence of selection (publication) bias.},

abstract = {Axons from the retina traverse different molecular territories as they navigate to the tectum. A single territory might span only a few cell diameters and harbour multiple guidance cues, many of which are beginning to be characterized. Also present in the pathway are 'modulators' that influence a growth cone's response to a coincident signal but do not guide growth directly. An emerging principle is that the growth cone, itself, changes molecularly as it journeys through the visual pathway. Growing retinal axons contain mRNAs, ubiquitinating and apoptotic enzymes, translation and degradation machinery. Guidance cues can trigger rapid and local synthesis, degradation and endocytosis of proteins, providing a fast and flexible way for growth cones to respond to cues in their microenvironment and to alter their responsiveness. The data raise the idea that the localized synthesis and downregulation of proteins might help to steer retinal axon growth and, further, might contribute to the changing character of a growth cone as it ages.},

Here we extend a previous approach based on information theory, the Generalized Transfer Entropy, to the reconstruction of connectivity of simulated neuronal networks of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We show that, due to the model-free nature of the developed measure, both kinds of connections can be reliably inferred if the average firing rate between synchronous burst events exceeds a small minimum frequency. Furthermore, we suggest, based on systematic simulations, that even lower spontaneous inter-burst rates could be raised to meet the requirements of our reconstruction algorithm by applying a weak spatially homogeneous stimulation to the entire network. By combining multiple recordings of the same in silico network before and after pharmacologically blocking inhibitory synaptic transmission, we show then how it becomes possible to infer with high confidence the excitatory or inhibitory nature of each individual neuron.},

Despite these apparent differences in modes of locomotion, both vertebrate and invertebrate species share, at least in part, comparable neural control mechanisms for locomotor rhythm and pattern generation and modulation. Significant advances have been made in recent years in studies of the genetic aspects of these control systems. Findings made specifically using Drosophila (fruit fly) models and preparations have contributed to further understanding of the key role of genes in locomotion. This review focuses on some of the main findings made in larval fruit flies while briefly summarizing the basic advantages of using this powerful animal model for studying the neural locomotor system.},

abstract = {It is often assumed that similar behaviors in related species are produced by similar neural mechanisms. To test this, we examined the neuronal basis of a simple swimming behavior in two nudibranchs (Mollusca, Opisthobranchia), Melibe leonina and Dendronotus iris. The side-to-side swimming movements of Dendronotus [1] strongly resemble those of Melibe [2, 3]. In Melibe, it was previously shown that the central pattern generator (CPG) for swimming is composed of two bilaterally symmetric pairs of identified interneurons, swim interneuron 1 (Si1) and swim interneuron 2 (Si2), which are electrically coupled ipsilaterally and mutually inhibit both contralateral counterparts [2, 4]. We identified homologs of Si1 and Si2 in Dendronotus. (Henceforth, homologous neurons in each species will be distinguished by the subscripts Den and Mel.) We found that Si2Den and Si2Mel play similar roles in generating the swim motor pattern. However, unlike Si1Mel, Si1 Den was not part of the swim CPG, was not strongly coupled to the ipsilateral Si2Den, and did not inhibit the contralateral neurons. Thus, species differences exist in the neuronal organization of the swim CPGs despite the similarity of the behaviors. Therefore, similarity in species-typical behavior is not necessarily predictive of common neural mechanisms, even for homologous neurons in closely related species. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Little is known, however, about the activation of these pathways at the level of the local neocortical microcircuit. We report a disynaptic inhibitory pathway among neocortical pyramidal cells (PCs). Inhibitory responses were evoked in layer 5 PCs following stimulation of individual neighboring PCs with trains of action potentials. The probability for inhibition between PCs was more than twice that of direct excitation, and inhibitory responses increased as a function of rate and duration of presynaptic discharge. Simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings indicated that inhibition originated from PC apical and tuft dendrites. Multineuron whole-cell recordings from PCs and interneurons combined with morphological reconstructions revealed the mediating interneurons as Martinotti cells. Martinotti cells received facilitating synapses from PCs and formed reliable inhibitory synapses onto dendrites of neighboring PCs. We describe this feedback pathway and propose it as a central mechanism for regulation of cortical activity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The developing neocortex contains two types of progenitor cells for glutamatergic, pyramidal-projection neurons. The first type, radial glia, produce neurons and glia, divide at the ventricular surface, and express Pax6, a homeodomain transcription factor. The second type, intermediate progenitor cells, are derived from radial glia, produce only neurons, and divide away from the ventricular surface. Here we show that the transition from radial glia to intermediate progenitor cell is associated with upregulation of Tbr2, a T-domain transcription factor, and downregulation of Pax6. Accordingly, Tbr2 expression in progenitor compartments (the subventricular zone and ventricular zone) rises and falls with cortical plate neurogenesis. The subsequent transition from intermediate progenitor cell to postmitotic neuron is marked by downregulation of Tbr2 and upregulation of Tbr1, another T-domain transcription factor. These findings delineate the transcription factor sequence Pax6 --{\textgreater} Tbr2 --{\textgreater} Tbr1 in the differentiation of radial glia --{\textgreater} intermediate progenitor cell --{\textgreater} postmitotic projection neuron. This transcription factor sequence is modified in preplate neurons, in which Tbr2 is transiently coexpressed with Tbr1, and in the direct differentiation pathway from radial glia --{\textgreater} postmitotic projection neuron, in which Tbr2 is expressed briefly or not at all.},

Only a small minority " innovated " and solved the task spontaneously, but most bees were able to learn to pull a string when trained in a stepwise manner. In addition, na{\"{i}}ve bees learnt the task by observing a trained demonstrator from a distance. Learning the behavior relied on a combination of simple associative mechanisms and trial-and-error learning and did not require " insight " : na{\"{i}}ve bees failed a " coiled-string experiment, " in which they did not receive instant visual feedback of the target moving closer when tugging on the string. In cultural diffusion experiments, the skill spread rapidly from a single knowl-edgeable individual to the majority of a colony's foragers. We observed that there were sev-eral sequential sets (" generations ") of learners, so that previously na{\"{i}}ve observers could first acquire the technique by interacting with skilled individuals and, subsequently, them-selves become demonstrators for the next " generation " of learners, so that the longevity of the skill in the population could outlast the lives of informed foragers. This suggests that, so long as animals have a basic toolkit of associative and motor learning processes, the key ingredients for the cultural spread of unusual skills are already in place and do not require sophisticated cognition.

abstract = {Short, high frequency stimulation bursts (4 pulses at 100 Hz) were applied to Schaffer/commissural projections to the CA1 field of rat hippocampal slices at 0.1, 0.2, 1.0 or 2.0-s intervals to assess their efficacy in eliciting long-term potentiation (LTP). Bursts repeated at 2-s intervals induced very little LTP; shorter repetition intervals reliably elicited LTP, with the 200-ms repetition interval producing the greatest potentiation. A short-term potentiation effect, which was maximal 20 s after the last burst and decayed within 10 min, was affected differently by the stimulation parameters than was LTP, suggesting that the two phenomena are due to different processes. The results indicate that patterns of stimulation resembling spike discharge patterns of hippocampal neurons in animals in exploratory situations are effective in inducing LTP and suggest temporal constraints on the mechanisms involved in triggering synaptic plasticity. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {doublesex (dsx) encodes sex-specific transcription factors (DSXF in females and DSXM in males) that act at the bottom of the Drosophila somatic sex determination hierarchy. dsx, which is conserved among diverse taxa, is responsible for directing all aspects of Drosophila somatic sexual differentiation outside the nervous system. The role of dsx in the nervous system remains minimally understood. Here, the mechanisms by which DSX acts to establish dimorphism in the central nervous system were examined. This study shows that the number of DSX-expressing cells in the central nervous system is sexually dimorphic during both pupal and adult stages. Additionally, the number of DSX-expressing cells depends on both the amount of DSX and the isoform present. One cluster of DSX-expressing neurons in the ventral nerve cord undergoes female-specific cell death that is DSXF-dependent. Another DSX-expressing cluster in the posterior brain undergoes more cell divisions in males than in females. Additionally, early in development, DSXM is present in a portion of the neural circuitry in which the male-specific product of fruitless (fru) is produced, in a region that has been shown to be critical for sex-specific behaviors. This study demonstrates that DSXM and FRUM expression patterns are established independent of each other in the regions of the central nervous system examined. In addition to the known role of dsx in establishing sexual dimorphism outside the central nervous system, the results demonstrate that DSX establishes sex-specific differences in neural circuitry by regulating the number of neurons using distinct mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Summary Chemotaxis is a powerful paradigm to investigate how nervous systems represent and integrate changes in sensory signals to direct navigational decisions. In the Drosophila melanogaster larva, chemotaxis mainly consists of an alternation of distinct behavioral modes: runs and directed turns. During locomotion, turns are triggered by the integration of temporal changes in the intensity of the stimulus. Upon completion of a turning maneuver, the direction of motion is typically realigned toward the odor gradient. While the anatomy of the peripheral olfactory circuits and the locomotor system of the larva are reasonably well documented, the neural circuits connecting the sensory neurons to the motor neurons remain unknown. We combined a loss-of-function behavioral screen with optogenetics-based clonal gain-of-function manipulations to identify neurons that are necessary and sufficient for the initiation of reorientation maneuvers in odor gradients. Our results indicate that a small subset of neurons residing in the subesophageal zone controls the rate of transition from runs to turns - a premotor function compatible with previous observations made in other invertebrates. After having shown that this function pertains to the processing of inputs from different sensory modalities (olfaction, vision, thermosensation), we conclude that the subesophageal zone operates as a general premotor center that regulates the selection of different behavioral programs based on the integration of sensory stimuli. The present analysis paves the way for a systematic investigation of the neural computations underlying action selection in a miniature brain amenable to genetic manipulations.},

abstract = {Although the physiological basis of erythermalgia, an autosomal dominant painful neuropathy characterized by redness of the skin and intermittent burning sensation of extremities, is not known, two mutations of Na(v)1.7, a sodium channel that produces a tetrodotoxin-sensitive, fast-inactivating current that is preferentially expressed in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and sympathetic ganglia neurons, have recently been identified in patients with primary erythermalgia. Na(v)1.7 is preferentially expressed in small-diameter DRG neurons, most of which are nociceptors, and is characterized by slow recovery from inactivation and by slow closed-state inactivation that results in relatively large responses to small, subthreshold depolarizations. Here we show that these mutations in Na(v)1.7 produce a hyperpolarizing shift in activation and slow deactivation. We also show that these mutations cause an increase in amplitude of the current produced by Na(v)1.7 in response to slow, small depolarizations. These observations provide the first demonstration of altered sodium channel function associated with an inherited painful neuropathy and suggest that these physiological changes, which confer hyperexcitability on peripheral sensory and sympathetic neurons, contribute to symptom production in hereditary erythermalgia.},

To address this shortcoming, we developed a long Stokes shift RFP-based Ca(2+) indicator, REX-GECO1, with optimal two-photon excitation at {\textless}1,000 nm. REX-GECO1 fluoresces at 585 nm when excited at 480 nm or 910 nm by a one- or two-photon process, respectively. We demonstrate that REX-GECO1 can be used as either a ratiometric or intensiometric Ca(2+) indicator in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (one- and two-photon) and the visual system of albino tadpoles (two-photon). Furthermore, we demonstrate single excitation wavelength two-colour Ca(2+) and glutamate imaging in organotypic cultures.},

This may seem to be a truism, but the broad temporal and spatial expression of most of the fly's "neuro genes" makes it difficult to exclude elements of such genes' actions as materially underlying reproductive behavior. "Courtship genes" that seem to play more particular roles were originally identified as sensory, learning, or rhythm mutations; their reproductive abnormalities have been especially informative for revealing components of male or female actions that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. Further behavioral mutations seemed originally to be courtship-specific, turned out not to have that property, and have led to a broadened perspective on the nature and action of Drosophila's sex-determination genes.},

abstract = {Animals generate diverse motor behaviors, yet how the same motor neurons generate distinct behaviors remains an open question. Drosophila larvae have multiple behaviors – e.g. forward crawling, backward crawling, self-righting and escape – and all of the body wall motor neurons (MNs) driving these behaviors have been identified. Despite impressive progress in mapping larval motor circuits, the role of most motor neurons in locomotion remains untested, the majority of premotor neurons (PMNs) remain to be identified, and a full understanding of proprioceptor-PMN-MN connectivity is missing. Here we report a comprehensive larval proprioceptor-PMN-MN connectome; describe individual muscle/MN phase activity during both forward and backward locomotor behaviors; identify PMN-MN connectivity motifs that could generate muscle activity phase relationships, plus selected experimental validation; identify proprioceptor-PMN connectivity that provides an anatomical explanation for the role of proprioception in promoting locomotor velocity; and identify a new candidate escape motor circuit. Finally, we generate a recurrent network model that produces the observed sequence of motor activity, showing that the identified pool of premotor neurons is sufficient to generate two distinct larval behaviors. We conclude that different locomotor behaviors can be generated by a specific group of premotor neurons generating behavior-specific motor rhythms.},

Identifying vulnerability genes for autism represents a major challenge in the field and allows the development of animal models for translational research. Mice lacking the mu opioid receptor gene (Oprm1(-/-)) were recently proposed as a monogenic mouse model of autism, based on severe deficits in social behavior and communication skills. We confirm this hypothesis by showing that adult Oprm1(-/-) animals recapitulate core and multiple comorbid behavioral symptoms of autism and also display anatomical, neurochemical, and genetic landmarks of the disease. Chronic facilitation of mGluR4 signaling, which we identified as a novel pharmacological target in ASDs in these mice, was more efficient in alleviating behavioral deficits than the reference molecule risperidone. Altogether, our data provide first evidence that disrupted mu opioid receptor signaling is sufficient to trigger a comprehensive autistic syndrome, maybe through blunted social reward processes, and this mouse model opens promising avenues for therapeutic innovation.},

Targeted deletion of the melanopsin gene attenuates these adaptive responses with no apparent change in the development and morphology of the mRGCs. Comprehensive identification of mRGCs and knowledge of their specific roles in image-forming and non-image forming photoresponses are currently lacking. We used a Cre-dependent GFP expression strategy in mice to genetically label the mRGCs. This revealed that only a subset of mRGCs express enough immunocytochemically detectable levels of melanopsin. We also used a Cre-inducible diphtheria toxin receptor (iDTR) expression approach to express the DTR in mRGCs. mRGCs develop normally, but can be acutely ablated upon diphtheria toxin administration. The mRGC-ablated mice exhibited normal outer retinal function. However, they completely lacked non-image forming visual responses such as circadian photoentrainment, light modulation of activity, and PLR. These results point to the mRGCs as the site of functional integration of the rod/cone and melanopsin phototransduction pathways and as the primary anatomical site for the divergence of image-forming and non-image forming photoresponses in mammals.},

Here we introduce cell labelling via photobleaching (CLaP), a method that enables instant, specific tagging of individual cells based on a wide array of criteria such as shape, behaviour or positional information. CLaP uses laser illumination to crosslink biotin onto the plasma membrane, coupled with streptavidin conjugates to label individual cells for genomic, cell-tracking, flow cytometry or ultra-microscopy applications. We show that the incorporated mark is stable, non-toxic, retained for several days, and transferred by cell division but not to adjacent cells in culture. To demonstrate the potential of CLaP for genomic applications, we combine CLaP with microfluidics-based single-cell capture followed by transcriptome-wide next-generation sequencing. Finally, we show that CLaP can also be exploited for inducing transient cell adhesion to substrates for microengineering cultures with spatially patterned cell types.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated calcium (Ca(2+)) channels initiate release of neurotransmitters at synapses, and regulation of presynaptic Ca(2+) channels has a powerful influence on synaptic strength. Presynaptic Ca(2+) channels form a large signaling complex, which targets synaptic vesicles to Ca(2+) channels for efficient release and mediates Ca(2+) channel regulation. Presynaptic plasticity regulates synaptic function on the timescale of milliseconds to minutes in response to neurotransmitters and the frequency of action potentials. This article reviews the regulation of presynaptic Ca(2+) channels by effectors and regulators of Ca(2+) signaling and describes the emerging evidence for a critical role of Ca(2+) channel regulation in control of neurotransmission and in presynaptic plasticity. Failure of function and regulation of presynaptic Ca(2+) channels leads to migraine, ataxia, and potentially other forms of neurological disease. We propose that presynaptic Ca(2+) channels serve as the regulatory node in a dynamic, multilayered signaling network that exerts short-term control of neurotransmission in response to synaptic activity.},

Although technical limitations have restricted the mapping of human and mouse 'connectomes' to the level of brain regions, a finer degree of functional resolution is attainable in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, due to the armamentarium of genetic tools available for this model organism. Currently, one of the most amenable approaches employed by Drosophila neurobiologists involves mapping neuronal circuitry underlying complex innate behaviors - courtship being a classic paradigm. We discuss recent studies aimed at identifying the cellular components of courtship neural circuits, mapping function in these circuits and defining causal relationships between neural activity and behavior. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {It is generally thought that transmitter release at mammalian central synapses is triggered by Ca2+ microdomains, implying loose coupling between presynaptic Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ sensors of exocytosis. Here we show that Ca2+ channel subunit immunoreactivity is highly concentrated in the active zone of GABAergic presynaptic terminals of putative parvalbumin-containing basket cells in the hippocampus. Paired recording combined with presynaptic patch pipette perfusion revealed that GABA release at basket cell-granule cell synapses is sensitive to millimolar concentrations of the fast Ca2+ chelator BAPTA but insensitive to the slow Ca2+ chelator EGTA. These results show that Ca2+ source and Ca2+ sensor are tightly coupled at this synapse, with distances in the range of 10-20 nm. Models of Ca2+ inflow-exocytosis coupling further reveal that the tightness of coupling increases efficacy, speed, and temporal precision of transmitter release. Thus, tight coupling contributes to fast feedforward and feedback inhibition in the hippocampal network. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The early observation that AAV can establish a latent infection by integrating into the host chromosome has been central to this interest. However, chromosomal integration is a two-edged sword, imparting on one hand the ability to maintain the therapeutic gene in progeny cells, and on the other hand, the risk of mutations that are deleterious to the host. A clearer understanding of the mechanism and efficiency of AAV integration, in terms of contributing viral and host-cell factors and circumstances, will provide a context in which to evaluate these potential benefits and risks. Research to date suggests that AAV integration in any context is inefficient, and that the persistence of AAV gene delivery vectors in tissues is largely attributable to episomal genomes.},

Wild-type males can distinguish between virgin females (which they court vigorously), and fertilized females (which they court less vigorously). After exposure to fertilized females, wild-type males modify their behavior by decreasing courtship to subsequent target virgins, an effect that may last for many hours. Like wild-type males, PKA-RI mutant males are also able to distinguish between virgin and fertilized females. PKA-RI males also modify their behavior towards virgin females after prior exposure to a fertilized female, but such an effect is short-lived, suggesting a defect in memory rather than learning. We also show that under these conditions the behavior of PKA-RI males is similar to that of amnesiac, dunce and rutabaga males.},

abstract = {It is unclear how regulatory genes establish neural circuits that compose sex-specific behaviors. The Drosophila melanogaster male courtship song provides a powerful model to study this problem. Courting males vibrate a wing to sing bouts of pulses and hums, called pulse and sine song, respectively. We report the discovery of male-specific thoracic interneurons—the TN1A neurons—that are required specifically for sine song. The TN1A neurons can drive the activity of a sex-non-specific wing motoneuron, hg1, which is also required for sine song. The male-specific connection between the TN1A neurons and the hg1 motoneuron is regulated by the sexual differentiation gene doublesex. We find that doublesex is required in the TN1A neurons during development to increase the density of the TN1A arbors that interact with dendrites of the hg1 motoneuron. Our findings demonstrate how a sexual differentiation gene can build a sex-specific circuit motif by modulating neuronal arborization.},

abstract = {Multireceptive neurones are found in the spinal dorsal horn and may be projection neurones and/or interneurones for polysynaptic reflexes. The cutaneous receptive field of a multireceptive neurone exhibits a gradient of sensitivity with the centre responding to any mechanical stimulus, including hair movements and light touch, while the periphery responds only to noxious stimuli. These neurones also receive signals from viscera, muscles and joints. This convergence of inputs means that multireceptive neurones are continuously capturing all the information from both the interface with the external environment (the skin) and the internal milieu (the viscera, muscles, etc.). This information constitutes a 'basic somaesthetic activity' that could help the somatosensory system build a 'global representation of the body'. In addition to be seen as a global entity, the output of multireceptive neurones should be understood in dynamic terms since the size of the peripheral fields of the individual neurones may change, as a result of the plasticity of both excitatory and inhibitory segmental processes. Furthermore, the activity of these neurones can be inhibited from most of the remaining parts of the body via supraspinal mechanisms. These diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) are triggered by peripheral A$\delta$- and C-fibres, involve brain structures confined to the caudal-most part of the medulla including the subnucleus reticularis dorsalis (SRD) and are mediated by descending pathways in the dorsolateral funiculi. A painful focus that both activates a segmental subset of neurones and inhibits the remaining population can seriously disrupt this basic activity, resulting in the distortion of the body representation in favour of the painful focus, which becomes pre-eminent and (relatively) oversized. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Codes of transcriptional regulators appear to specify in a hierarchical fashion the cell type, motoneuron sub-types and eventually unique cellular identities. Recent studies show that patterns of connectivity in the periphery are mirrored by patterns of dendritic arborisation centrally thereby providing a neuronal correlate of connectivity to the anatomy of the motor system in the periphery.

In insects, only a few descending neurons have been associated with specific behaviors. To explore how descending neurons control an insect's movements, we developed a novel method to systematically assay the behavioral effects of activating individual neurons on freely behaving terrestrial D. melanogaster. We calculated a two-dimensional representation of the entire behavior space explored by these flies, and we associated descending neurons with specific behaviors by identifying regions of this space that were visited with increased frequency during optogenetic activation. Applying this approach across a large collection of descending neurons, we found that (1) activation of most of the descending neurons drove stereotyped behaviors, (2) in many cases multiple descending neurons activated similar behaviors, and (3) optogenetically activated behaviors were often dependent on the behavioral state prior to activation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Dudek1992,
abstract = {We tested a theoretical prediction that patterns of excitatory input activity that consistently fail to activate target neurons sufficiently to induce synaptic potentiation will instead cause a specific synaptic depression. To realize this situation experimentally, the Schaffer collateral projection to area CA1 in rat hippocampal slices was stimulated electrically at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 50 Hz. Nine hundred pulses at 1-3 Hz consistently yielded a depression of the CA1 population excitatory postsynaptic potential that persisted without signs of recovery for greater than 1 hr after cessation of the conditioning stimulation. This long-term depression was specific to the conditioned input, ruling out generalized changes in postsynaptic responsiveness or excitability. Three lines of evidence suggest that this effect is accounted for by a modification of synaptic effectiveness rather than damage to or fatigue of the stimulated inputs. First, the effect was dependent on the stimulation frequency; 900 pulses at 10 Hz caused no lasting change, and at 50 Hz a synaptic potentiation was usually observed. Second, the depressed synapses continued to support long-term potentiation in response to a high-frequency tetanus. Third, the effects of conditioning stimulation could be prevented by application of NMDA receptor antagonists. Thus, our data suggest that synaptic depression can be triggered by prolonged NMDA receptor activation that is below the threshold for inducing synaptic potentiation. We propose that this mechanism is important for the modifications of hippocampal response properties that underlie some forms of learning and memory.},

abstract = {In order to release neurotransmitter synchronously in response to a presynaptic action potential, synaptic vesicles must be both release competent and located close to presynaptic Ca2+ channels. It has not been shown, however, which of the two is the more decisive factor. We tested this issue at the calyx of Held synapse by combining Ca2+ uncaging and electrophysiological measurements of postsynaptic responses. After depletion of the synaptic vesicles that are responsible for synchronous release during action potentials, uniform elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by Ca2+ uncaging could still elicit rapid release. The Ca2+ sensitivity of remaining vesicles was reduced no more than 2-fold, which is insufficient to explain the slow-down of the kinetics of release (10-fold) observed during a depolarizing pulse. We conclude that recruitment of synaptic vesicles to sites where Ca2+ channels cluster, rather than fusion competence, is a limiting step for rapid neurotransmitter release in response to presynaptic action potentials.},

Purkinje cells are among the first neurons to populate the cerebellar cortex, where they sprout exuberant axon collaterals. We used multiple patch-clamp recordings targeted with two-photon microscopy to characterize monosynaptic connections between the Purkinje cells of juvenile mice. We found that Purkinje cell axon collaterals projected asymmetrically in the sagittal plane, directed away from the lobule apex. On the basis of our anatomical and physiological characterization of this connection, we constructed a network model that robustly generated waves of activity that traveled along chains of connected Purkinje cells. Consistent with the model, we observed traveling waves of activity in Purkinje cells in sagittal slices from young mice that require GABA(A) receptor-mediated transmission and intact Purkinje cell axon collaterals. These traveling waves are absent in adult mice, suggesting they have a developmental role in wiring the cerebellar cortical microcircuit.},

We used comprehensive transcriptome analysis of 622 single mouse neurons to classify them in an unbiased manner, independent of any a priori knowledge of sensory subtypes. Our results reveal eleven types: three distinct low-threshold mechanoreceptive neurons, two proprioceptive, and six principal types of thermosensitive, itch sensitive, type C low-threshold mechanosensitive and nociceptive neurons with markedly different molecular and operational properties. Confirming previously anticipated major neuronal types, our results also classify and provide markers for new, functionally distinct subtypes. For example, our results suggest that itching during inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis is linked to a distinct itch-generating type. We demonstrate single-cell RNA-seq as an effective strategy for dissecting sensory responsive cells into distinct neuronal types.

abstract = {Cadherins and the immunoglobulin (Ig) proteins give rise to a multitude of surface receptors, which function as diverse cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) or signal-transducing receptors. These functions are often interdependent, and rely on a high degree of specificity in homophilic binding as well as heterophilic interactions. The Drosophila receptor Dscam is an exceptional example of homophilic binding specificity involved in a number of important biological processes, such as neural wiring and innate immunity. Combinatorial use of alternatively spliced Ig-domains enables the generation of an estimated 18,000 isoform-specific homophilic receptor pairs. Although isoform diversity of Dscam is unique to arthropods, recent genetic analysis of vertebrate DSCAM (Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule) genes has revealed an intriguing conservation of molecular functions underlying neural wiring. This review covers the multiple functions of Dscam across different species highlighting its remarkable versatility as well as its conserved basic functions in neural development. We discuss how an unprecedented expansion of complex alternative splicing has been uniquely employed by arthropods to generate diverse surface receptors, important for cell-cell communication, molecular self-recognition in neurons, and innate immune defenses. We end with a speculative hypothesis reconciling the striking differences in Dscam and DSCAM gene structures with their conserved functions in molecular recognition underlying neural circuit formation.},

abstract = {Nearly all studies of Drosophila melanogaster courtship have focused exclusively on male behaviour. Female precopulatory behaviour is often relegated to 'accept' or 'reject' mating, and how female behaviour interacts with that of males remains largely unknown. Using a video-computing approach, we measured 10 behavioural states and 22 elementary behaviours that occur during the precopulatory phase of Canton-S (Cs) flies. Male and female behaviours were studied under a variety of social conditions. This allowed us to identify which one(s) is relevant to courtship or to general activity. Our analysis showed that the courtship repertoire was not constant over time, as female and male behaviours varied during courtship, and that virgin Cs females showed several behavioural sequences whose frequency, latency and total duration could predict their mating success. The most striking index of females' willingness to copulate was the way they extruded the ovipositor: a partial extrusion stimulated male courtship, whereas total extrusion inhibited it. Furthermore, females that mated preened their abdomen more frequently than did females that did not mate. We also observed that male sexual activity was strongly increased when the female emitted a tiny volatile droplet at the tip of the ovipositor. We hypothesized that partial ovipositor extrusion, droplet emission and abdominal preening are related behaviours that result in the active dispersion of compounds spread on the female's abdomen. Such a detailed picture of the precopulatory behaviours should allow better characterization of the sensory stimuli exchanged during courtship in Drosophila. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

We used the temperature-sensitive activator dTRPA1 to probe the roles of fru(M)- and dsx-expressing neurons in male courtship behaviors. Almost all steps of courtship, from courtship song to ejaculation, can be induced at very high levels through activation of either all fru(M) or all dsx neurons in solitary males. Detailed characterizations reveal different roles for fru(M) and dsx in male courtship. Surprisingly, the system for mate discrimination still works well when all dsx neurons are activated, but is impaired when all fru(M) neurons are activated. Most strikingly, we provide evidence for a fru(M)-independent courtship pathway that is primarily vision dependent.},

The structure-function relationships of T1R receptors remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate the different functional roles of T1R extracellular and transmembrane domains in ligand recognition and G protein coupling. Similar to other family C G protein-coupled receptors, the N-terminal Venus flytrap domain of T1R2 is required for recognizing sweeteners, such as aspartame and neotame. The G protein coupling requires the transmembrane domain of T1R2. Surprisingly, the C-terminal transmembrane domain of T1R3 is required for recognizing sweetener cyclamate and sweet taste inhibitor lactisole. Because T1R3 is the common subunit in the sweet taste receptor and the umami taste receptor, we tested the interaction of lactisole and cyclamate with the umami taste receptor. Lactisole inhibits the activity of the human T1R1/T1R3 receptor, and, as predicted, blocked the umami taste of l-glutamate in human taste tests. Cyclamate does not activate the T1R1/T1R3 receptor by itself, but potentiates the receptor's response to l-glutamate. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the different functional roles of T1R3 and T1R2 and the presence of multiple ligand binding sites on the sweet taste receptor.},

abstract = {Activation of the transcription factor CREB is thought to be important in the formation of long-term memory in several animal species. The phosphorylation of a serine residue at position 133 of CREB is critical for activation of CREB. This phosphorylation is rapid when driven by brief synaptic activity in hippocampal neurons. It is initiated by a highly local, rise in calcium ion concentrations near the cell membrane, but culminates in the activation of a specific calmodulin-dependent kinase known as CaMK IV, which is constitutively present in the neuronal nucleus. It is unclear how the signal is conveyed from the synapse to the nucleus. We show here that brief bursts of activity cause a swift (approximately 1 min) translocation of calmodulin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and that this translocation is important for the rapid phosphorylation of CREB. Certain Ca2+ entry systems (L-type Ca2+ channels and NMDA receptors) are able to cause mobilization of calmodulin, whereas others (N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels) are not. This translocation of calmodulin provides a form of cellular communication that combines the specificity of local Ca2+ signalling with the ability to produce action at a distance.},

abstract = {Courtship song is a critical component of male courtship behavior in Drosophila, making the female more receptive to copulation and communicating species-specific information [1-6]. Sex mosaic studies have shown that the sex of certain regions of the central nervous system (CNS) is critical to song production [7]. Our examination of one of these regions, the mesothoracic ganglion (Msg), revealed the coexpression of two sex-determination genes, fruitless (fru) and doublesex (dsx). Because both genes are involved in creating a sexually dimorphic CNS [8, 9] and are necessary for song production [10-13], we investigated the individual contributions of fru and dsx to the specification of a male CNS and song production. We show a novel requirement for dsx in specifying a sexually dimorphic population of fru-expressing neurons in the Msg. Moreover, by using females constitutively expressing the male-specific isoforms of fru (Fru(M)), we show a critical requirement for the male isoform of dsx (Dsx(M)), alongside Fru(M), in the specification of courtship song. Therefore, although Fru(M) expression is sufficient for the performance of many male-specific behaviors [14], we have shown that without Dsx(M), the determination of a male-specific CNS and thus a full complement of male behaviors are not realized.},

@article{Watt2004,
abstract = {Most excitatory glutamatergic synapses contain both AMPA and NMDA receptors, but whether these receptors are regulated together or independently during synaptic plasticity has been controversial. Although long-term potentiation (LTP) is thought to selectively enhance AMPA currents and alter the NMDA-to-AMPA ratio, this ratio is well conserved across synapses onto the same neuron. This suggests that the NMDA-to-AMPA ratio is only transiently perturbed by LTP. To test this, we induced LTP at rat neocortical synapses and recorded mixed AMPA-NMDA currents. We observed rapid LTP of AMPA currents, as well as delayed potentiation of NMDA currents that required previous AMPA potentiation. The delayed potentiation of NMDA currents restored the original NMDA-to-AMPA ratio within 2 h of LTP induction. These data suggest that recruitment of AMPA receptors to synapses eventually induces a proportional increase in NMDA current. This may ensure that LTP does not alter the relative contributions of these two receptors to synaptic transmission and information processing.},

It was eventually concluded that plasticity depends on many factors, including cell type. More recently, it has become increasingly clear that plasticity is regulated at an even finer grained level; it is specific to the synapse type, a concept we denote synapse-type-specific plasticity (STSP). Here, we review recent developments in the field of STSP, discussing both long-term and short-term variants and with particular emphasis on neocortical function. As there are dozens of neocortical cell types, there is a multiplicity of forms of STSP, the vast majority of which have never been explored. We argue that to understand the brain and synaptic diseases, we have to grapple with STSP.},

We developed an approach, targeted recombination in active populations (TRAP), to obtain genetic access to neurons that were activated by defined stimuli. This method utilizes mice in which the tamoxifen-dependent recombinase CreERT2 is expressed in an activity-dependent manner from the loci of the immediate early genes Arc and Fos. Active cells that express CreERT2 can only undergo recombination when tamoxifen is present, allowing genetic access to neurons that are active during a time window of less than 12hr. We show that TRAP can provide selective access to neurons activated by specific somatosensory, visual, and auditory stimuli and by experience in a novel environment. When combined with tools for labeling, tracing, recording, and manipulating neurons, TRAP offers a powerful approach for understanding how the brain processes information and generates behavior},

When applied to degenerating neurons, iDISCO revealed unexpected variability in number of apoptotic neurons within individual sensory ganglia despite tight control of total number in all ganglia. It also permitted imaging of single degenerating axons in adult brain and the first visualization of cleaved Caspase-3 in degenerating embryonic sensory axons in vivo, even single axons. iDISCO enables facile volume imaging of immunolabeled structures in complex tissues.

Understanding how mechanical signals are processed in multicellular model systems is critical for connecting cellular processes to tissue- and organism-level responses. However, progress in the field that studies these phenomena, mechanobiology, has been limited by lack of appropriate experimental techniques for applying repeatable mechanical stimuli to intact organs and model organisms. Microfluidic platforms, a subgroup of microsystems that use liquid flow for manipulation of objects, are a promising tool for studying mechanobiology of small model organisms due to their size scale and ease of customization. In this work, we describe design considerations involved in developing a microfluidic device for studying mechanobiology. Then, focusing on worms, fruit flies, and zebrafish, we review current microfluidic platforms for mechanobiology of multicellular model organisms and their tissues and highlight research opportunities in this developing field.},

abstract = {Traditionally, NMDA receptors are located postsynaptically; yet, putatively presynaptic NMDA receptors (preNMDARs) have been reported. Although implicated in controlling synaptic plasticity, their function is not well understood and their expression patterns are debated. We demonstrate that, in layer 5 of developing mouse visual cortex, preNMDARs specifically control synaptic transmission at pyramidal cell inputs to other pyramidal cells and to Martinotti cells, while leaving those to basket cells unaffected. We also reveal a type of interneuron that mediates ascending inhibition. In agreement with synapse-specific expression, we find preNMDAR-mediated calcium signals in a subset of pyramidal cell terminals. A tuned network model predicts that preNMDARs specifically reroute information flow in local circuits during high-frequency firing, in particular by impacting frequency-dependent disynaptic inhibition mediated by Martinotti cells, a finding that we experimentally verify. We conclude that postsynaptic cell type determines presynaptic terminal molecular identity and that preNMDARs govern information processing in neocortical columns.},

With its relevance to processes such as learning and memory, the technique has produced a vast literature on mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in animal models. To date, the most promising method for transferring these methods to humans is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a noninvasive method of stimulating neural pathways in the brain of conscious subjects through the intact scalp. However, effects on synaptic plasticity reported are often weak, highly variable between individuals, and rarely last longer than 30 min. Here we describe a very rapid method of conditioning the human motor cortex using rTMS that produces a controllable, consistent, long-lasting, and powerful effect on motor cortex physiology and behavior after an application period of only 20-190 s.},

abstract = {The medicinal leech has served as an important experimental preparation for neuroscience research since the late 19th century. Initial anatomical and developmental studies dating back more than 100 years ago were followed by behavioral and electrophysiological investigations in the first half of the 20th century. More recently, intense studies of the neuronal mechanisms underlying leech movements have resulted in detailed descriptions of six behaviors described in this review; namely, heartbeat, local bending, shortening, swimming, crawling, and feeding. Neuroethological studies in leeches are particularly tractable because the CNS is distributed and metameric, with only 400 identifiable, mostly paired neurons in segmental ganglia. An interesting, yet limited, set of discrete movements allows students of leech behavior not only to describe the underlying neuronal circuits, but also interactions among circuits and behaviors. This review provides descriptions of six behaviors including their origins within neuronal circuits, their modification by feedback loops and neuromodulators, and interactions between circuits underlying with these behaviors. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, GluR-A-/- mice showed a reduction in functional AMPA receptors, with the remaining receptors preferentially targeted to synapses. Thus, the CA1 soma-patch currents were strongly reduced, but glutamatergic synaptic currents were unaltered; and evoked dendritic and spinous Ca2+ transients, Ca2+-dependent gene activation, and hippocampal field potentials were as in the wild type. In adult GluR-A-/- mice, associative long-term potentiation (LTP) was absent in CA3 to CA1 synapses, but spatial learning in the water maze was not impaired. The results suggest that CA1 hippocampal LTP is controlled by the number or subunit composition of AMPA receptors and show a dichotomy between LTP in CA1 and acquisition of spatial memory.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Sleep is a dynamic process in most animals, involving distinct stages that probably perform multiple functions for the brain. Before sleep functions can be initiated, it is likely that behavioral responsiveness to the outside world needs to be reduced, even while the animal is still awake. Recent work in Drosophila has uncovered a sleep switch in the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) of the fly's central brain, but it is not known whether these sleep-promoting neurons also govern the acute need to ignore salient stimuli in the environment during sleep transitions. We found that optogenetic activation of the sleep switch suppressed behavioral responsiveness to mechanical stimuli, even in awake flies, indicating a broader role for these neurons in regulating arousal. The dFB-mediated suppression mechanism and its associated neural correlates requires innexin6 expression, suggesting that the acute need to reduce sensory perception when flies fall asleep is mediated in part by electrical synapses.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The formalin test for nociception, which is predominantly used with rats and mice, involves moderate, continuous pain generated by injured tissue. In this way it differs from most traditional tests of nociception which rely upon brief stimuli of threshold intensity. In this article we describe the main features of the formalin test, including the characteristics of the stimulus and how changes in nociceptive behaviour may be measured and interpreted. The response to formalin shows an early and a late phase. The early phase seems to be caused predominantly by C-fibre activation due to the peripheral stimulus, while the late phase appears to be dependent on the combination of an inflammatory reaction in the peripheral tissue and functional changes in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. These functional changes seem to be initiated by the C-fibre barrage during the early phase. In mice, the behavioural response in the late phase depends on the ambient temperature. We argue that the peripheral tissue temperature as well as other factors influencing the peripheral inflammation may affect the response, possibly confounding the results obtained with the test. Furthermore, we discuss the methods of recording the response and the value of observing more than one aspect of behaviour. Scoring of several behavioural variables provides a means of assessing motor or sensorimotor function as possible causes for changes in behaviour. In conclusion, the formalin test is a valuable addition to the battery of methods available to study nociception.},

abstract = {The Drosophila insulin receptor (DInR) regulates a diverse array of biological processes including growth, axon guidance, and sugar homeostasis. Growth regulation by DInR is mediated by Chico, the Drosophila homolog of vertebrate insulin receptor substrate proteins IRS1-4. In contrast, DInR regulation of photoreceptor axon guidance in the developing visual system is mediated by the SH2-SH3 domain adaptor protein Dreadlocks (Dock). In vitro studies by others identified five NPXY motifs, one in the juxtamembrane region and four in the signaling C-terminal tail (C-tail), important for interaction with Chico. Here we used yeast two-hybrid assays to identify regions in the DInR C-tail that interact with Dock. These Dock binding sites were in separate portions of the C-tail from the previously identified Chico binding sites. To test whether these sites are required for growth or axon guidance in whole animals, a panel of DInR proteins, in which the putative Chico and Dock interaction sites had been mutated individually or in combination, were tested for their ability to rescue viability, growth and axon guidance defects of dinr mutant flies. Sites required for viability were identified. Unexpectedly, mutation of both putative Dock binding sites, either individually or in combination, did not lead to defects in photoreceptor axon guidance. Thus, either sites also required for viability are necessary for DInR function in axon guidance and/or there is redundancy built into the DInR/Dock interaction such that Dock is able to interact with multiple regions of DInR. We also found that simultaneous mutation of all five NPXY motifs implicated in Chico interaction drastically decreased growth in both male and female adult flies. These animals resembled chico mutants, supporting the notion that DInR interacts directly with Chico in vivo to control body size. Mutation of these five NPXY motifs did not affect photoreceptor axon guidance, segregating the roles of DInR in the processes of growth and axon guidance.},

abstract = {Highly branched class IV multidendritic sensory neurons of the Drosophila larva function as polymodal nociceptors that are necessary for behavioral responses to noxious heat ({\textgreater}39°C) or noxious mechanical ({\textgreater}30 mN) stimuli. However, the molecular mechanisms that allow these cells to detect both heat and force are unknown. Here, we report that the pickpocket (ppk) gene, which encodes a Degenerin/Epithelial Sodium Channel (DEG/ENaC) subunit, is required for mechanical nociception but not thermal nociception in these sensory cells. Larvae mutant for pickpocket show greatly reduced nociception behaviors in response to harsh mechanical stimuli. However, pickpocket mutants display normal behavioral responses to gentle touch. Tissue-specific knockdown of pickpocket in nociceptors phenocopies the mechanical nociception impairment without causing defects in thermal nociception behavior. Finally, optogenetically triggered nociception behavior is unaffected by pickpocket RNAi, which indicates that ppk is not generally required for the excitability of the nociceptors. Interestingly, DEG/ENaCs are known to play a critical role in detecting gentle touch stimuli in Caenorhabditis elegans and have also been implicated in some aspects of harsh touch sensation in mammals. Our results suggest that neurons that detect harsh touch in Drosophila utilize similar mechanosensory molecules. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {GABAergic activity is thought to influence developing neocortical sensory circuits. Yet the late postnatal maturation of local layer (L)4 circuits suggests alternate sources of GABAergic control in nascent thalamocortical networks. We show that a population of L5b, somatostatin (SST)-positive interneuron receives early thalamic synaptic input and, using laser-scanning photostimulation, identify an early transient circuit between these cells and L4 spiny stellates (SSNs) that disappears by the end of the L4 critical period. Sensory perturbation disrupts the transition to a local GABAergic circuit, suggesting a link between translaminar and local control of SSNs. Conditional silencing of SST+ interneurons or conversely biasing the circuit toward local inhibition by overexpression of neuregulin-1 type 1 results in an absence of early L5b GABAergic input in mutants and delayed thalamic innervation of SSNs. These data identify a role for L5b SST+ interneurons in the control of SSNs in the early postnatal neocortex.},

We present a bioluminescence method, based on the calcium-reporter Aequorin (AEQ), that exploits targeted transgenic expression patterns to identify activity of specific neural groups in the larval Drosophila nervous system. We first refine, for intact but constrained larva, the choice of Aequorin transgene and method of delivery of the co-factor coelenterazine and assay the luminescence signal produced for different neural expression patterns and concentrations of co-factor, using standard photo-counting techniques. We then develop an apparatus that allows simultaneous measurement of this neural signal while video recording the crawling path of an unconstrained animal. The setup also enables delivery and measurement of an olfactory cue (CO2) and we demonstrate the ability to record synchronized changes in Kenyon cell activity and crawling speed caused by the stimulus. Our approach is thus shown to be an effective and affordable method for studying the neural basis of behavior in Drosophila larvae.},

abstract = {Halorhodopsin (NpHR), a light-driven microbial chloride pump, enables silencing of neuronal function with superb temporal and spatial resolution. Here, we generated a transgenic line of Drosophila that drives expression of NpHR under control of the Gal4/UAS system. Then, we used it to dissect the functional properties of neural circuits that regulate larval peristalsis, a continuous wave of muscular contraction from posterior to anterior segments. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of NpHR by showing that global and continuous NpHR-mediated optical inhibition of motor neurons or sensory feedback neurons induce the same behavioral responses in crawling larvae to those elicited when the function of these neurons are inhibited by Shibire(ts), namely complete paralyses or slowed locomotion, respectively. We then applied transient and/or focused light stimuli to inhibit the activity of motor neurons in a more temporally and spatially restricted manner and studied the effects of the optical inhibition on peristalsis. When a brief light stimulus (1-10 sec) was applied to a crawling larva, the wave of muscular contraction stopped transiently but resumed from the halted position when the light was turned off. Similarly, when a focused light stimulus was applied to inhibit motor neurons in one or a few segments which were about to be activated in a dissected larva undergoing fictive locomotion, the propagation of muscular constriction paused during the light stimulus but resumed from the halted position when the inhibition ({\textgreater}5 sec) was removed. These results suggest that (1) Firing of motor neurons at the forefront of the wave is required for the wave to proceed to more anterior segments, and (2) The information about the phase of the wave, namely which segment is active at a given time, can be memorized in the neural circuits for several seconds.},

abstract = {The major neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by a disabling loss of the daily pattern of sleep and wakefulness, which may be reflective of a compromise to the underlying circadian clock that times the sleep cycle. At a molecular level, the canonical property of neurodegenerative diseases is aberrant aggregation of otherwise soluble neuronal proteins. They can thus be viewed as disturbances of proteostasis, raising the question whether the two features - altered daily rhythms and molecular aggregation - are related. Recent discoveries have highlighted the fundamental contribution of circadian clocks to the correct ordering of daily cellular metabolic cycles, imposing on peripheral organs such as the liver a strict programme that alternates between anabolic and catabolic states. The discovery that circadian mechanisms are active in local brain regions suggests that they may impinge upon physiological and pathological elements that influence pro-neurodegenerative aggregation. This review explores how introducing the dimension of circadian time and the circadian clock might refine the analysis of aberrant aggregation, thus expanding our perspective on the cell biology common to neurodegenerative diseases. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

Although evidence is incomplete, it seems that cyclic AMP enhances the calcium-mediated release of neurotransmitter in some neurones. A simple form of memory in the mollusc Aplysia is probably encoded as a cyclic AMP-induced enhancement of neurotransmission at certain synapses of the central nervous system. The possibility that cyclic AMP participates in learning mechanisms may be explored using genetic mutants. For this purpose the fruitfly Drosophila is suitable as it is genetically well characterized and can learn through olfaction, vision or taste. We show here that independent searches for mutations of olfactory learning and of cyclic AMP metabolism, and for mutations causing female infertility have each led to the same gene--the dunce gene. Our evidence indicates that the normal dunce gene may specify a cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase.},

We applied unsupervised learning to large-scale neuronal recordings in behaving mice from circuits involved in spatial cognition and uncovered a highly-organized internal structure of ensemble activity patterns. This emergent structure allowed defining for each neuron an ‘internal tuning-curve' that characterizes its activity relative to the network activity, rather than relative to any predefined external variable, revealing place-tuning and head-direction tuning without relying on measurements of place or head-direction. Similar investigation in prefrontal cortex revealed schematic representations of distances and actions, and exposed a previously unknown variable, the ‘trajectory-phase'. The internal structure was conserved across mice, allowing using one animal's data to decode another animal's behavior. Thus, the internal structure of neuronal activity itself enables reconstructing internal representations and discovering new behavioral variables hidden within a neural code.},

abstract = {Short-term plasticity (STP) denotes changes in synaptic strength that last up to tens of seconds. It is generally thought that STP impacts information transfer across synaptic connections and may thereby provide neurons with, for example, the ability to detect input coherence, to maintain stability and to promote synchronization. STP is due to a combination of mechanisms, including vesicle depletion and calcium accumulation in synaptic terminals. Different forms of STP exist, depending on many factors, including synapse type. Recent evidence shows that synapse dependence holds true even for connections that originate from a single presynaptic cell, which implies that postsynaptic target cell type can determine synaptic short-term dynamics. This arrangement is surprising, since STP itself is chiefly due to presynaptic mechanisms. Target-specific synaptic dynamics in addition imply that STP is not a bug resulting from synapses fatiguing when driven too hard, but rather a feature that is selectively implemented in the brain for specific functional purposes. As an example, target-specific STP results in sequential somatic and dendritic inhibition in neocortical and hippocampal excitatory cells during high-frequency firing. Recent studies also show that the Elfn1 gene specifically controls STP at some synapse types. In addition, presynaptic NMDA receptors have been implicated in synapse-specific control of synaptic dynamics during high-frequency activity. We argue that synapse-specific STP deserves considerable further study, both experimentally and theoretically, since its function is not well known. We propose that synapse-specific STP has to be understood in the context of the local circuit, which requires combining different scientific disciplines ranging from molecular biology through electrophysiology to computer modeling.},

abstract = {We examined how correlated firing controls axon remodeling, using in vivo time-lapse imaging and electrophysiological analysis of individual retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons that were visually stimulated either synchronously or asynchronously relative to neighboring inputs in the Xenopus laevis optic tectum. RGCs stimulated out of synchrony rapidly lost the ability to drive tectal postsynaptic partners while their axons grew and added many new branches. In contrast, synchronously activated RGCs produced fewer new branches, but these were more stable. The effects of synchronous activation were prevented by the inhibition of neurotransmitter release and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade, which is consistent with a role for synaptic NMDAR activation in the stabilization of axonal branches and suppression of further exploratory branch addition.},

New methods and reagents allowed efficient production of 12 novel ??G rabies variants from plasmid DNA. These new rabies viruses express useful neuroscience tools, including the Ca2+ indicator GCaMP3 for monitoring activity; Channelrhodopsin-2 for photoactivation; allatostatin receptor for inactivation by ligand application; and rtTA, ERT2CreERT2, or FLPo, for control of gene expression. These new tools allow neurons targeted on the basis of their connectivity to have their function assayed or their activity or gene expression manipulated. Combining these tools with in vivo imaging and optogenetic methods and/or inducible gene expression in transgenic mice will facilitate experiments investigating neural circuit development, plasticity, and function that have not been possible with existing reagents. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Cells of the central nervous system were once thought to be incapable of regeneration. This dogma has been challenged in the last decade with studies showing new, migrating stem cells in the brain in many rodent injury models and findings of new neurones in the human hippocampus in adults. Moreover, there are reports of bone marrow-derived cells developing neuronal and vascular phenotypes and aiding in repair of injured brain. These findings have fuelled excitement and interest in regenerative medicine for neurological diseases, arguably the most difficult diseases to treat. There are numerous proposed regenerative approaches to neurological diseases. These include cell therapy approaches in which cells are delivered intracerebrally or are infused by an intravenous or intra-arterial route; stem cell mobilization approaches in which endogenous stem and progenitor cells are mobilized by cytokines such as granulocyte colony stimulatory factor (GCSF) or chemokines such as SDF-1; trophic and growth factor support, such as delivering brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) into the brain to support injured neurones; these approaches may be used together to maximize recovery. While initially, it was thought that cell therapy might work by a 'cell replacement' mechanism, a large body of evidence is emerging that cell therapy works by providing trophic or 'chaperone' support to the injured tissue and brain. Angiogenesis and neurogenesis are coupled in the brain. Increasing angiogenesis with adult stem cell approaches in rodent models of stroke leads to preservation of neurones and improved functional outcome. A number of stem and progenitor cell types has been proposed as therapy for neurological disease ranging from neural stem cells to bone marrow derived stem cells to embryonic stem cells. Any cell therapy approach to neurological disease will have to be scalable and easily commercialized if it will have the necessary impact on public health. Currently, bone marrow-derived cell populations such as the marrow stromal cell, multipotential progenitor cells, umbilical cord stem cells and neural stem cells meet these criteria the best. Of great clinical significance, initial evidence suggests these cell types may be delivered by an allogeneic approach, so strict tissue matching may not be necessary. The most immediate impact on patients will be achieved by making use of the trophic support capability of cell therapy and not by a cell replacement mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Retinal photoreceptors entrain the circadian system to the solar day. This photic resetting involves cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated upregulation of Per genes within individual cells of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Our detailed understanding of this pathway is poor, and it remains unclear why entrainment to a new time zone takes several days. By analyzing the light-regulated transcriptome of the SCN, we have identified a key role for salt inducible kinase 1 (SIK1) and CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) in clock re-setting. An entrainment stimulus causes CRTC1 to coactivate CREB, inducing the expression of Per1 and Sik1. SIK1 then inhibits further shifts of the clock by phosphorylation and deactivation of CRTC1. Knockdown of Sik1 within the SCN results in increased behavioral phase shifts and rapid re-entrainment following experimental jet lag. Thus SIK1 provides negative feedback, acting to suppress the effects of light on the clock. This pathway provides a potential target for the regulation of circadian rhythms. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

We validated noninvasive magnetic control over neuronal activity by demonstrating remote stimulation of cells using in vitro calcium imaging assays, electrophysiological recordings in brain slices, in vivo electrophysiological recordings in the brains of freely moving mice, and behavioral outputs in zebrafish and mice. As proof of concept, we used Magneto to delineate a causal role of striatal dopamine receptor 1 neurons in mediating reward behavior in mice.

Second, two papers recently challenged the notion that TPCs are NAADP-regulated Ca(2+) channels by suggesting that they are highly selective Na(+) channels regulated by the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate and by ATP. This paper aims critically to evaluate the evidence for TPCs as NAADP targets and to discuss how the new findings fit in with what we know about endo-lysosomal Ca(2+) stores.},

In the present studies, the constitutively active Akt and a nonmyristoylated control mutant were expressed in 3T3-L1 cells that can be induced to differentiate into adipocytes. The constitutively active Akt induced glucose uptake into adipocytes in the absence of insulin by stimulating translocation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter 4 to the plasma membrane. The constitutively active Akt also increased the synthesis of the ubiquitously expressed glucose transporter 1. The increased glucose influx in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes directed lipid but not glycogen synthesis. These results indicate that Akt can regulate glucose uptake and metabolism.},

abstract = {The primary circadian pacemaker, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian brain, is photoentrained by light signals from the eyes through the retinohypothalamic tract. Retinal rod and cone cells are not required for photoentrainment. Recent evidence suggests that the entraining photoreceptors are retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to the SCN. The visual pigment for this photoreceptor may be melanopsin, an opsin-like protein whose coding messenger RNA is found in a subset of mammalian RGCs. By cloning rat melanopsin and generating specific antibodies, we show that melanopsin is present in cell bodies, dendrites, and proximal axonal segments of a subset of rat RGCs. In mice heterozygous for tau-lacZ targeted to the melanopsin gene locus, beta-galactosidase-positive RGC axons projected to the SCN and other brain nuclei involved in circadian photoentrainment or the pupillary light reflex. Rat RGCs that exhibited intrinsic photosensitivity invariably expressed melanopsin. Hence, melanopsin is most likely the visual pigment of phototransducing RGCs that set the circadian clock and initiate other non-image-forming visual functions.},

abstract = {The modifications occurring in the brain during learning and memory are still poorly understood but may involve long-lasting changes in synaptic transmission (synaptic plasticity). In perirhinal cortex, a lasting decrement in neuronal responsiveness is associated with visual familiarity discrimination, leading to the hypothesis that long-term depression (LTD)-like synaptic plasticity may underlie recognition memory. LTD relies on internalization of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) through interaction between their GluR2 subunits and AP2, the clathrin adaptor protein required for endocytosis. We demonstrate that a peptide that blocks interactions between GluR2 and AP2 blocks LTD in perirhinal cortex in vitro. Viral transduction of this peptide in perirhinal cortex produced striking deficits in visual recognition memory. Furthermore, there was a deficit of LTD in perirhinal cortex slices from virally transduced, recognition memory-deficient animals. These results suggest that internalization of AMPA receptors, a process critical for the expression of LTD in perirhinal cortex, underlies visual recognition memory. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Alterations in postsynaptic glutamate receptors are believed to contribute to the expression of various forms of LTP and LTD, but the relative importance of presynaptic mechanisms is controversial. In addition, while aggregate synaptic input to a cell can undergo sequential and graded (incremental) LTP and LTD, it has been suggested that individual synapses may only support binary changes between initial and modified levels of strength. We have addressed these issues by combining electrophysiological methods with two-photon optical quantal analysis of plasticity at individual active (non-silent) Schaffer collateral synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute slices of hippocampus from adolescent rats. We find that these synapses sustain graded, bidirectional long-term plasticity. Remarkably, changes in potency are small and insignificant; long-term plasticity at these synapses is expressed overwhelmingly via presynaptic changes in reliability of transmitter release. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Human studies in cocaine-dependent individuals have shown alterations in brain structure, but it is less clear how these changes may be related to the clinical phenotype of cocaine dependence characterized by impulsive behaviours and compulsive drug-taking. Here we compared self-report, behavioural and structural magnetic resonance imaging data on a relatively large sample of cocaine-dependent individuals (n = 60) with data on healthy volunteers (n = 60); and we investigated the relationships between grey matter volume variation, duration of cocaine use, and measures of impulsivity and compulsivity in the cocaine-dependent group. Cocaine dependence was associated with an extensive system of abnormally decreased grey matter volume in orbitofrontal, cingulate, insular, temporoparietal and cerebellar cortex, and with a more localized increase in grey matter volume in the basal ganglia. Greater duration of cocaine dependence was correlated with greater grey matter volume reduction in orbitofrontal, cingulate and insular cortex. Greater impairment of attentional control was associated with reduced volume in insular cortex and increased volume of caudate nucleus. Greater compulsivity of drug use was associated with reduced volume in orbitofrontal cortex. Cocaine-dependent individuals had abnormal structure of corticostriatal systems, and variability in the extent of anatomical changes in orbitofrontal, insular and striatal structures was related to individual differences in duration of dependence, inattention and compulsivity of cocaine consumption.},

Here we combine rabies-virus-dependent retrograde mono-trans-synaptic labelling with genetics to control the location, number and type of {\&}apos;starter{\&}apos; cortical neurons, from which we trace their presynaptic neurons. We find that individual cortical neurons receive input from multiple mitral cells representing broadly distributed glomeruli. Different cortical areas represent the olfactory bulb input differently. For example, the cortical amygdala preferentially receives dorsal olfactory bulb input, whereas the piriform cortex samples the whole olfactory bulb without obvious bias. These differences probably reflect different functions of these cortical areas in mediating innate odour preference or associative memory.

abstract = {The method of c-fos immunodetection was used to map the distributions of neurons in the lumbar spinal dorsal horn that were activated following intracutaneous (i.c.) microinjection, or iontophoretic application, of different irritant chemicals to the lateral hindpaw of rats. Microinjections (1 microl) of histamine, serotonin (5-HT), nicotine, capsaicin, or formalin each elicited similar distributions of Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) in laminae I-II of the ipsilateral superficial dorsal horn, with little or no FLI in deeper laminae or contralaterally. In laminae I and II, FLI cell counts were significantly higher following i.c. histamine, 5-HT, capsaicin, formalin, and noxious pinch, compared to i.c. saline controls. Capsaicin-evoked FLI was dose-dependent. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed no significant difference in spatial distributions of FLI induced by any of the chemical or pinch stimuli. Iontophoretic application of histamine, 5-HT, or nicotine also elicited similar distributions of FLI in the superficial dorsal horn, and cell counts of FLI were significantly higher compared to controls receiving iontophoretic vehicle (methyl cellulose). These results indicate either that individual laminae I-II neurons are activated by each of the irritant chemicals, or that neurons selectively responsive to a given irritant are comingled without any apparent laminar segregation.},

We examined the efficacy of low-frequency trains (1-5 Hz) in producing long-term depression (LTD) or depotentiation in the hippocampus of the awake adult rat and in anesthetized rats aged from 10 days to 3 mo. 2. In the dentate gyrus we found no evidence that low-frequency trains produce either depotentiation or LTD in the awake, adult animal or in the anesthetized animal at any age tested (10 days-adult). 3. In area CA1 of both awake and anesthetized adult rats, we also found no evidence that low-frequency trains induced either LTD or depotentiation. Only in area CA1 of very young rats (10-11 days) was clear evidence for LTD and depotentiation obtained; at this age experiments were only possible in anesthetized animals. By 16 days, the ability to display both LTD and depotentiation was lost. 4. These experiments suggest that repetitive low-frequency stimulation evokes a developmentally regulated form of activity-dependent depression that in the hippocampus is limited to specific pathways in the young animal. Our results leave open the question of whether alternative patterns of activity can induce LTD and/or depotentiation in the adult awake rat.},

abstract = {The complexity of nervous systems alters the evolvability of behaviour. Complex nervous systems are phylogenetically constrained; nevertheless particular species-specific behaviours have repeatedly evolved, suggesting a predisposition towards those behaviours. Independently evolved behaviours in animals that share a common neural architecture are generally produced by homologous neural structures, homologous neural pathways and even in the case of some invertebrates, homologous identified neurons. Such parallel evolution has been documented in the chromatic sensitivity of visual systems, motor behaviours and complex social behaviours such as pair-bonding. The appearance of homoplasious behaviours produced by homologous neural substrates suggests that there might be features of these nervous systems that favoured the repeated evolution of particular behaviours. Neuromodulation may be one such feature because it allows anatomically defined neural circuitry to be re-purposed. The developmental, genetic and physiological mechanisms that contribute to nervous system complexity may also bias the evolution of behaviour, thereby affecting the evolvability of species-specific behaviour.},

We now report, however, that systems consolidation can occur extremely quickly if an associative "schema" into which new information is incorporated has previously been created. In experiments using a hippocampal-dependent paired-associate task for rats, the memory of flavor-place associations became persistent over time as a putative neocortical schema gradually developed. New traces, trained for only one trial, then became assimilated and rapidly hippocampal-independent. Schemas also played a causal role in the creation of lasting associative memory representations during one-trial learning. The concept of neocortical schemas may unite psychological accounts of knowledge structures with neurobiological theories of systems memory consolidation.},

abstract = {Ornaments used in courtship often vary wildly among species, reflecting the evolutionary interplay between mate preference functions and the constraints imposed by natural selection. Consequently, understanding the evolutionary dynamics responsible for ornament diversification has been a longstanding challenge in evolutionary biology. However, comparing radically different ornaments across species, as well as different classes of ornaments within species, is a profound challenge to understanding diversification of sexual signals. Using novel methods and a unique natural history dataset, we explore evolutionary patterns of ornament evolution in a group − the birds-of-paradise − exhibiting dramatic phenotypic diversification widely assumed to be driven by sexual selection. Rather than the tradeoff between ornament types originally envisioned by Darwin and Wallace, we found positive correlations among cross-modal (visual/acoustic) signals indicating functional integration of ornamental traits into a composite unit − the courtship phenotype. Furthermore, given the broad theoretical and empirical support for the idea that systemic robustness − functional overlap and interdependency − promotes evolutionary innovation, we posit that birds-of-paradise have radiated extensively through ornamental phenotype space as a consequence of the robustness in the courtship phenotype that we document at a phylogenetic scale. We suggest that the degree of robustness in courtship phenotypes among taxa can provide new insights into the relative influence of sexual and natural selection on phenotypic radiations.},

While progress has been made towards the identification of central mechanisms coordinating limb movement, only limited knowledge exists regarding the generation and execution of sequential motor action patterns at the level of individual motoneurons. Here we use Drosophila proboscis extension as a model system for a reaching-like behavior. We first provide a neuroanatomical description of the motoneurons and muscles contributing to proboscis motion. Using genetic targeting in combination with artificial activation and silencing assays we identify the individual motoneurons controlling the five major sequential steps of proboscis extension and retraction. Activity-manipulations during naturally evoked proboscis extension show that orchestration of serial motoneuron activation does not rely on feed-forward mechanisms. Our data support a model in which central command circuits recruit individual motoneurons to generate task-specific proboscis extension sequences.},

abstract = {Information is stored in neural circuits through long-lasting changes in synaptic strengths. Most studies of information storage have focused on mechanisms such as long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD), in which synaptic strengths change in a synapse-specific manner. In contrast, little attention has been paid to mechanisms that regulate the total synaptic strength of a neuron. Here we describe a new form of synaptic plasticity that increases or decreases the strength of all of a neuron's synaptic inputs as a function of activity. Chronic blockade of cortical culture activity increased the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) without changing their kinetics. Conversely, blocking GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-mediated inhibition initially raised firing rates, but over a 48-hour period mESPC amplitudes decreased and firing rates returned to close to control values. These changes were at least partly due to postsynaptic alterations in the response to glutamate, and apparently affected each synapse in proportion to its initial strength. Such 'synaptic scaling' may help to ensure that firing rates do not become saturated during developmental changes in the number and strength of synaptic inputs, as well as stabilizing synaptic strengths during Hebbian modification and facilitating competition between synapses.},

However, the neurons that orchestrate these motor programs as well as their cellular properties and connectivity are poorly understood. Here we identify a population of molecularly defined motor synergy encoder (MSE) neurons in the mouse spinal cord that may represent a central node in neural pathways for voluntary and reflexive movement. This population receives direct inputs from the motor cortex and sensory pathways and, in turn, has monosynaptic outputs to spinal motorneurons. Optical stimulation of MSE neurons drove reliable patterns of activity in multiple motor groups, and we found that the evoked motor patterns varied on the basis of the rostrocaudal location of the stimulated MSE. We speculate that these neurons comprise a cellular network for encoding coordinated motor output programs.},

Using a PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE fusion protein as a real-time reporter of circadian dynamics in mice, we report that, contrary to previous work, peripheral tissues are capable of self-sustained circadian oscillations for {\textgreater}20 cycles in isolation. In addition, peripheral organs expressed tissue-specific differences in circadian period and phase. Surprisingly, lesions of the SCN in mPer2(Luciferase) knockin mice did not abolish circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues, but instead caused phase desynchrony among the tissues of individual animals and from animal to animal. These results demonstrate that peripheral tissues express self-sustained, rather than damped, circadian oscillations and suggest the existence of organ-specific synchronizers of circadian rhythms at the cell and tissue level.},

abstract = {Increases in dopamine concentration in limbic brain regions have been postulated to underlie the reinforcing effects of psychostimulant drugs in laboratory animals. However, neither the qualitative nor the quantitative relationship between drug-induced increases in brain dopamine and the reinforcing effects of psychostimulant drugs have been investigated in humans. Positron emission tomograph and [(11)C]raclopride, a dopamine D(2) receptor radioligand that competes with endogenous dopamine for occupancy of the D(2) receptors, were used to measure changes in brain dopamine after different doses of i.v. methylphenidate in 14 healthy controls. In parallel, measures for self-reports of drug effects were obtained to assess their relationship to methylphenidate-induced changes in brain dopamine. The intensity of the "high" induced by methylphenidate was significantly correlated with the levels of released dopamine (r = 0.78, p {\textless}.001); subjects having the greatest increases were those who perceived the most intense high. This relationship remained significant after partialing out for dose and concentration of methylphenidate in plasma. Furthermore, subjects for whom methylphenidate did not increase dopamine did not perceive a high. These results represent the first clear demonstration that stimulant-induced high, a mood descriptor that reflects reinforcing effects of drugs in humans, is associated with increases in brain dopamine, and also that there is a quantitative relationship between levels of D(2) receptor occupancy by dopamine and the intensity of the high.},

We addressed this question in the context of the myotopic map formed by limb muscles innervated by spinal lateral motor column (LMC) motor axons where the Eph receptor signals specifying growth cone trajectory are restricted by Foxp1 and Lhx1 transcription factors. We show that the localisation of LMC neuron cell bodies can be dissociated from axon trajectory choice by either the loss or gain of function of the Reelin signalling pathway. The response of LMC motor neurons to Reelin is gated by Foxp1- and Lhx1-mediated regulation of expression of the critical Reelin signalling intermediate Dab1. Together, these observations point to identical transcription factors that control motor axon guidance and soma migration and reveal the molecular hierarchy of myotopic organisation.},

Naturally occurring herpes and rabies viruses have been used for transneuronal circuit tracing for decades. Depending on the type of virus and strain, virus can travel preferentially in the anterograde or the retrograde direction. More recently, genetic modifications have allowed for many improvements. These include: reduced pathogenicity; addition of marker genes; control of synaptic spread; pseudotyping for infection of selected cells; addition of ancillary genetic elements for combining circuit tracing with manipulation of activity or functional assays. These modifications, along with the likelihood of future developments, suggest that neurotropic viruses will be increasingly important and effective tools for future studies of neural circuits. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Selective genetic manipulation of neuronal function in vivo requires techniques for targeting gene expression to specific cells. Existing systems accomplish this using the promoters of endogenous genes to drive expression of transgenes directly in cells of interest or, in "binary" systems, to drive expression of a transcription factor or recombinase that subsequently activates the expression of other transgenes. All such techniques are constrained by the limited specificity of the available promoters. We introduce here a combinatorial system in which the DNA-binding (DBD) and transcription-activation (AD) domains of a transcription factor are independently targeted using two different promoters. The domains heterodimerize to become transcriptionally competent and thus drive transgene expression only at the intersection of the expression patterns of the two promoters. We use this system to dissect a neuronal network in Drosophila by selectively targeting expression of the cell death gene reaper to subsets of neurons within the network. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

At cellular levels, adrenergic signaling increases dendrite excitability, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that activation of $\beta$2-adrenoceptors promoted STD long-term synaptic potentiation at mouse hippocampal excitatory synapses by inactivating dendritic Kv1.1-containing potassium channels, which increased dendrite excitability and facilitated dendritic propagation of postsynaptic depolarization, potentially improving coincidental activation of pre- and postsynaptic terminals. We further demonstrate that adrenergic modulation of Kv1.1 was mediated by the signaling scaffold SAP97, which, through direct protein-protein interactions, escorts $\beta$2 signaling to remove Kv1.1 from the dendrite surface. These results reveal a mechanism through which the postsynaptic signaling scaffolds bridge the aroused brain state to promote induction of synaptic plasticity and potentially to enhance spike timing and memory encoding.},

abstract = {Accurate and robust detection of mRNA molecules in thick tissue samples can reveal gene expression patterns in single cells within their native environment. Preserving spatial relationships while accessing the transcriptome of selected cells is a crucial feature for advancing many biological areas, from developmental biology to neuroscience. However, because of the high autofluorescence background of many tissue samples, it is difficult to detect single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) signals robustly in opaque thick samples. Here, we draw on principles from the emerging discipline of dynamic nucleic acid nanotechnology to develop a robust method for multi-color, multi-RNA, imaging in deep tissues using single-molecule hybridization chain reaction (smHCR). Using this approach, single transcripts can be imaged using epifluorescence, confocal or selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) depending on the imaging depth required. We show that smHCR has high sensitivity in detecting mRNAs in cell culture and whole-mount zebrafish embryos, and that combined with SPIM and PACT (PAssive CLARITY Technique) tissue hydrogel embedding and clearing, smHCR can detect single mRNAs deep within thick (0.5 mm) brain slices. By simultaneously achieving {\~{}}20-fold signal amplification and diffraction-limited spatial resolution, smHCR offers a robust and versatile approach for detecting single mRNAs in situ, including in thick tissues where high background undermines the performance of unamplified smFISH.},

abstract = {In the developing brain, many glutamate synapses have been found to transmit only NMDA receptor-mediated signaling, that is, they are AMPA-silent. This result has been taken to suggest that glutamate synapses are initially AMPA-silent when they are formed, and that AMPA signaling is acquired through activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. The present study on CA3-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus of the neonatal rat suggests that AMPA-silent synapses are created through a form of activity-dependent silencing of AMPA signaling. We found that AMPA signaling, but not NMDA signaling, could be very rapidly silenced by presynaptic electrical stimulation at frequencies commonly used to probe synaptic function (0.05-1 Hz). Although this AMPA silencing required a rise in postsynaptic Ca(2+), it did not require activation of NMDA receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors or voltage-gated calcium channels. The AMPA silencing, possibly explained by a removal of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, could subsequently be reversed by paired presynaptic and postsynaptic activity.},

Injection of formalin into the hind paw induces a biphasic pain response; the first phase is thought to result from direct activation of primary afferent sensory neurons, whereas the second phase has been proposed to reflect the combined effects of afferent input and central sensitization in the dorsal horn. Here we show that formalin excites sensory neurons by directly activating TRPA1, a cation channel that plays an important role in inflammatory pain. Formalin induced robust calcium influx in cells expressing cloned or native TRPA1 channels, and these responses were attenuated by a previously undescribed TRPA1-selective antagonist. Moreover, sensory neurons from TRPA1-deficient mice lacked formalin sensitivity. At the behavioral level, pharmacologic blockade or genetic ablation of TRPA1 produced marked attenuation of the characteristic flinching, licking, and lifting responses resulting from intraplantar injection of formalin. Our results show that TRPA1 is the principal site of formalin's pain-producing action in vivo, and that activation of this excitatory channel underlies the physiological and behavioral responses associated with this model of pain hypersensitivity.},

abstract = {Quantitative behavioral measurements are important for answering questions across scientific disciplines—from neuroscience to ecology. State-of-the-art deep-learning methods offer major advances in data quality and detail by allowing researchers to automatically estimate locations of an animal's body parts directly from images or videos. However, currently-available animal pose estimation methods have limitations in speed and robustness. Here we introduce a new easy-to-use software toolkit, DeepPoseKit, that addresses these problems using an efficient multi-scale deep-learning model, called Stacked DenseNet, and a fast GPU-based peak-detection algorithm for estimating keypoint locations with subpixel precision. These advances improve processing speed {\textgreater}2× with no loss in accuracy compared to currently-available methods. We demonstrate the versatility of our methods with multiple challenging animal pose estimation tasks in laboratory and field settings—including groups of interacting individuals. Our work reduces barriers to using advanced tools for measuring behavior and has broad applicability across the behavioral sciences.},

abstract = {Cognitive monitoring is an approach utilizing realtime brain signal decoding (RBSD) for gaining information on the ongoing cognitive user state. In recent decades this approach has brought valuable insight into the cognition of an interacting human. Automated RBSD can be used to set up a brain-computer interface (BCI) providing a novel input modality for technical systems solely based on brain activity. In BCIs the user usually sends voluntary and directed commands to control the connected computer system or to communicate through it. In this paper we propose an extension of this approach by fusing BCI technology with cognitive monitoring, providing valuable information about the users' intentions, situational interpretations and emotional states to the technical system. We call this approach passive BCI. In the following we give an overview of studies which utilize passive BCI, as well as other novel types of applications resulting from BCI technology. We especially focus on applications for healthy users, and the specific requirements and demands of this user group. Since the presented approach of combining cognitive monitoring with BCI technology is very similar to the concept of BCIs itself we propose a unifying categorization of BCI-based applications, including the novel approach of passive BCI.},

In the primary visual cortex, this activity-dependent development is triggered by the functional maturation of local inhibitory connections and driven by a specific, late-developing subset of interneurons. Ultimately, the structural consolidation of competing sensory inputs is mediated by a proteolytic reorganization of the extracellular matrix that occurs only during the critical period. The reactivation of this process, and subsequent recovery of function in conditions such as amblyopia, can now be studied with realistic circuit models that might generalize across systems.},

The early observation that AAV can establish a latent infection by integrating into the host chromosome has been central to this interest. However, chromosomal integration is a two-edged sword, imparting on one hand the ability to maintain the therapeutic gene in progeny cells, and on the other hand, the risk of mutations that are deleterious to the host. A clearer understanding of the mechanism and efficiency of AAV integration, in terms of contributing viral and host-cell factors and circumstances, will provide a context in which to evaluate these potential benefits and risks. Research to date suggests that AAV integration in any context is inefficient, and that the persistence of AAV gene delivery vectors in tissues is largely attributable to episomal genomes.},

To overcome these limitations, we developed a chronic in vivo recording and stimulation platform based on flexible mesh electronics, and we demonstrated stable multiplexed local field potentials and single-unit recordings in mouse brains for at least 8 months without probe repositioning. Properties of acquired signals suggest robust tracking of the same neurons over this period. This recording and stimulation platform allowed us to evoke stable single-neuron responses to chronic electrical stimulation and to carry out longitudinal studies of brain aging in freely behaving mice. Such advantages could open up future studies in mapping and modulating changes associated with learning, aging and neurodegenerative diseases.},

Here we review its preclinical and clinical properties and discuss translational aspects. Vortioxetine increases serotonergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, cholinergic, histaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in brain structures associated with MDD. These multiple effects likely derive from its interaction with 5-HT-receptor-mediated negative feedback mechanisms controlling neuronal activity. In particular, 5-HT3 receptors may play a prominent role, since their blockade i) increases pyramidal neuron activity by removing 5-HT3 receptor-mediated excitation of GABA interneurons, and ii) augments SSRI effects on extracellular 5-HT. However, modulation of the other 5-HT receptor subtypes also likely contributes to vortioxetine's pharmacological effects. Preclinical animal models reveal differences from SSRIs and SNRIs, including antidepressant-like activity, increased synaptic plasticity and improved cognitive function. Vortioxetine had clinical efficacy in patients with MDD: 11 placebo-controlled studies (including one in elderly) with efficacy in 8 (7 positive, 1 supportive), 1 positive active comparator study plus a positive relapse prevention study. In two positive studies, vortioxetine was superior to placebo in pre-defined cognitive outcome measures. The clinically effective dose range (5-20mg/day) spans {\~{}}50 to {\textgreater}80{\%} SERT occupancy. SERT and 5-HT3 receptors are primarily occupied at 5mg, while at 20mg, all targets are likely occupied at functionally relevant levels. The side-effect profile is similar to that of SSRIs, with gastrointestinal symptoms being most common, and a low incidence of sexual dysfunction and sleep disruption possibly ascribed to vortioxetine's receptor modulation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Wide-field-of-view mesoscopic cortical imaging with genetically encoded sensors enables decoding of regional activity and connectivity in anesthetized and behaving mice; however, the kinetics of most genetically encoded sensors can be suboptimal for in vivo characterization of frequency bands higher than 1-3 Hz. Furthermore, existing sensors, in particular those that measure calcium (genetically encoded calcium indicators; GECIs), largely monitor suprathreshold activity. Using a genetically encoded sensor of extracellular glutamate and in vivo mesoscopic imaging, we demonstrate rapid kinetics of virally transduced or transgenically expressed glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter iGluSnFR. In both awake and anesthetized mice, we imaged an 8 x 8 mm field of view through an intact transparent skull preparation. iGluSnFR revealed cortical representation of sensory stimuli with rapid kinetics that were also reflected in correlation maps of spontaneous cortical activities at frequencies up to the alpha band (8-12 Hz). iGluSnFR resolved temporal features of sensory processing such as an intracortical reverberation during the processing of visual stimuli. The kinetics of iGluSnFR for reporting regional cortical signals were more rapid than those for Emx-GCaMP3 and GCaMP6s and comparable to the temporal responses seen with RH1692 voltage sensitive dye (VSD), with similar signal amplitude. Regional cortical connectivity detected by iGluSnFR in spontaneous brain activity identified functional circuits consistent with maps generated from GCaMP3 mice, GCaMP6s mice, or VSD sensors. Viral and transgenic iGluSnFR tools have potential utility in normal physiology, as well as neurologic and psychiatric pathologies in which abnormalities in glutamatergic signaling are implicated. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We have characterized the usage of virally transduced or transgenically expressed extracellular glutamate sensor iGluSnFR to perform wide-field-of-view mesoscopic imaging of cortex in both anesthetized and awake mice. Probes for neurotransmitter concentration enable monitoring of brain activity and provide a more direct measure of regional functional activity that is less dependent on nonlinearities associated with voltage-gated ion channels. We demonstrate functional maps of extracellular glutamate concentration and that this sensor has rapid kinetics that enable reporting high-frequency signaling. This imaging strategy has utility in normal physiology and pathologies in which altered glutamatergic signaling is observed. Moreover, we provide comparisons between iGluSnFR and genetically encoded calcium indicators and voltage-sensitive dyes.},

We used narrow-diameter channels to constrain behavior to simple, rhythmic crawling. We quantified crawling at the organism, segment, and muscle levels. We showed that Drosophila larval crawling is made up of a series of periodic strides. Each stride consists of two phases. First, while most abdominal segments remain planted on the substrate, the head, tail, and gut translocate; this "visceral pistoning" moves the center of mass. The movement of the center of mass is likely powered by muscle contractions in the head and tail. Second, the head and tail anchor while a body wall wave moves each abdominal segment in the direction of the crawl. These two phases can be observed occurring independently in embryonic stages before becoming coordinated at hatching. During forward crawls, abdominal body wall movements are powered by simultaneous contraction of dorsal and ventral muscle groups, which occur concurrently with contraction of lateral muscles of the adjacent posterior segment. During reverse crawls, abdominal body wall movements are powered by phase-shifted contractions of dorsal and ventral muscles; and ventral muscle contractions occur concurrently with contraction of lateral muscles in the adjacent anterior segment. This work lays a foundation for use of Drosophila larva as a model system for studying the genetics and development of rhythmic behavior.},

abstract = {Observational learning is a powerful survival tool allowing individuals to learn about threat-predictive stimuli without directly experiencing the pairing of the predictive cue and punishment. This ability has been linked to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). To investigate how information is encoded and transmitted through this circuit, we performed electrophysiological recordings in mice observing a demonstrator mouse undergo associative fear conditioning and found that BLA-projecting ACC (ACC→BLA) neurons preferentially encode socially derived aversive cue information. Inhibition of ACC→BLA alters real-time amygdala representation of the aversive cue during observational conditioning. Selective inhibition of the ACC→BLA projection impaired acquisition, but not expression, of observational fear conditioning. We show that information derived from observation about the aversive value of the cue is transmitted from the ACC to the BLA and that this routing of information is critically instructive for observational fear conditioning. Video Abstract: [Figure presented] For an individual to watch another's experience and learn from it, signals need to move from cortical neurons to the basolateral amygdala during detection and integration of the necessary social cues.},

We replaced this insert with a GAL4 element, P[GAL4,w+], recovering two lines with insertions in opposite orientations at the locus, one of which demonstrated fru-specific mutant phenotypes.

abstract = {Experimental data suggests that a first hypothesis about the content of a complex visual scene is available as early as 150 ms after stimulus presentation. Other evidence suggests that recognition in the visual cortex of mammals is a bidirectional, often top-down driven process. Here, we present a spiking neural network model that demonstrates how the cortex can use both strategies: Faced with a new stimulus, the cortex first tries to catch the gist of the scene. The gist is then fed back as global hypothesis to influence and redirect further bottom-up processing. We propose that these two modes of processing are carried out in different layers of the cortex. A cortical column may, thus, be primarily defined by the specific connectivity that links neurons in different layers into a functional circuit. Given an input, our model generates an initial hypothesis after only a few milliseconds. The first wave of action potentials traveling up the hierarchy activates representations of features and feature combinations. In most cases, the correct feature representation is activated strongest and precedes all other candidates with millisecond precision. Thus, our model codes the reliability of a response in the relative latency of spikes. In the subsequent refinement stage where high-level activity modulates lower stages, this activation dominance is propagated back, influencing its own afferent activity to establish a unique decision. Thus, top-down influence de-activates representations that have contributed to the initial hypothesis about the current stimulus, comparable to predictive coding. Features that do not match the top-down prediction trigger an error signal that can be the basis for learning new representations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Upon checkpoint activation, a prereplicative complex is assembled that contains ORC, Cdc6, Cdc7, and MCM proteins but lacks Cdc45. The checkpoint is ATM dependent. Cdk2/CyclinE acts downstream of ATM and is downregulated by Cdk2 phosphorylation on tyrosine 15.

This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions.

We now show that a noninvasive BCI that uses scalp-recorded electroencephalographic activity and an adaptive algorithm can provide humans, including people with spinal cord injuries, with multidimensional point-to-point movement control that falls within the range of that reported with invasive methods in monkeys. In movement time, precision, and accuracy, the results are comparable to those with invasive BCIs. The adaptive algorithm used in this noninvasive BCI identifies and focuses on the electroencephalographic features that the person is best able to control and encourages further improvement in that control.

However, it has been forcefully shown that the Euclidean distance is a very brittle distance measure. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a much more robust distance measure for time series, allowing similar shapes to match even if they are out of phase in the time axis. Because of this flexibility, DTW is widely used in science, medicine, industry and finance. Unfortunately however, DTW does not obey the triangular inequality, and thus has resisted attempts at exact indexing. Instead, many researchers have introduced approximate indexing techniques, or abandoned the idea of indexing and concentrated on speeding up sequential search. In this work, we introduce a novel technique for the exact indexing of DTW. We prove that our method guarantees no false dismissals and we demonstrate its vast superiority over all competing approaches in the largest and most comprehensive set of time series indexing experiments ever undertaken.},

abstract = {The insect central complex (CX) is a conserved brain region containing 60 + neuronal subtypes, several of which contribute to navigation. It is not known how CX neuronal diversity is generated or how developmental origin of subtypes relates to function. We mapped the developmental origin of four key CX subtypes and found that neurons with similar origin have similar axon/dendrite targeting. Moreover, we found that the temporal transcription factor (TTF) Eyeless/Pax6 regulates the development of two recurrently-connected CX subtypes: Eyeless loss simultaneously produces ectopic P-EN neurons with normal axon/dendrite projections, and reduces the number of E-PG neurons. Furthermore, transient loss of Eyeless during development impairs adult flies' capacity to perform celestial navigation. We conclude that neurons with similar developmental origin have similar connectivity, that Eyeless maintains equal E-PG and P-EN neuron number, and that Eyeless is required for the development of circuits that control adult navigation.Every task that an animal performs, even a simple one, typically requires numerous signals to pass across complex networks of cells called neurons. These networks develop early in an animal's life, beginning when progenitor cells called neural stem cells divide over and over to produce new cells. Specific molecular signals then induce these new cells to become different types of neurons. However, in many animals, it is poorly understood what these critical molecular signals are and how they work.Fruit flies, for example, have a network of neurons that control how they navigate when flying. The same type of progenitor cell gives rise to at least four types of neurons in this network; these progenitor cells make an increasing amount of a protein called Eyeless as they age.Sullivan et al. have now specifically disrupted production of the Eyeless protein in the progenitor cells, and found that this altered the relative numbers of navigation neurons. The fruit flies had too many of some types of navigation neurons and too few of others. Fruit flies normally navigate in a variety of directions relative to the sun, which may allow them to disperse and find food. This was not the case in experiments where the production of Eyeless was briefly disrupted when the flies were larvae. In these experiments, the adult flies tended to head towards a bright light (that represented the sun) much more often than normal, which would presumably keep them from dispersing effectively. This was true even if the disruption of Eyeless was not long enough to change the numbers of neuron types, showing the protein is important in determining both how these navigation neurons form networks, and whether they are born at all.A better understanding of the complexities of how healthy networks of neurons develop may give scientists more insight into what goes wrong during human developmental disorders that affect the brain. In theory, it may also someday lead to tools that can help to repair the brain if it is damaged.},

abstract = {The initial structural and functional development of visual circuits in reptiles, birds, and mammals happens independent of sensory experience. After eye opening, visual experience further refines and elaborates circuits that are critical for normal visual function. Innate genetic programs that code for gradients of molecules provide gross positional information for developing nerve cells, yet much of the cytoarchitectural complexity and synaptogenesis of neurons depends on calcium influx, neurotransmitter release, and neural activity before the onset of vision. In fact, specific spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity, or 'retinal waves', emerge amidst the development of the earliest connections made between excitable cells in the developing eye. These patterns of spontaneous activity, which have been observed in all amniote retinae examined to date, may be an evolved adaptation for species with long gestational periods before the onset of functional vision, imparting an informational robustness and redundancy to guide development of visual maps across the nervous system. Recent experiments indicate that retinal waves play a crucial role in the development of interconnections between different parts of the visual system, suggesting that these spontaneous patterns serve as a template-matching mechanism to prepare higher-order visually associative circuits for the onset of visuomotor learning and behavior. Key questions for future studies include determining the exact sources and nature of spontaneous activity during development, characterizing the interactions between neural activity and transcriptional gene regulation, and understanding the extent of circuit connectivity governed by retinal waves within and between sensory-motor systems. ?? 2013.},

The best understood form of long-term potentiation is induced by the activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex. This subtype of glutamate receptor endows long-term potentiation with Hebbian characteristics, and allows electrical events at the postsynaptic membrane to be transduced into chemical signals which, in turn, are thought to activate both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms to generate a persistent increase in synaptic strength.},

Major obstacles to understanding cortical architecture include the diversity of cell types, their highly recurrent local and global connectivity, dynamic circuit operations, and a convoluted developmental assembly process rooted in the genome. With our increasing knowledge of gene expression and developmental genetic principles, it is now feasible to launch a program of genetic dissection of cortical circuits through systematic targeting of cell types and fate mapping of neural progenitors. Strategic design of even a modest number of mouse driver lines will facilitate efforts tocompile a cell type parts list, build a Cortical Cell Atlas, establish experimental access to modern tools, integrate studies across levels, and provide coordinates for tracing developmental trajectory from circuit assembly to functional operation.},

@article{Kirkwood1994,
abstract = {We discovered in slices of rat visual cortex that reliable long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic responses in layer III could be elicited by theta burst stimulation delivered to a site in the middle of the cortical thickness, corresponding mainly to layer IV. This synaptic plasticity was reflected in the extracellular field potentials and intracellular EPSPs in layer III, but was not observed in the intracellular responses of layer V neurons, suggesting a preferential involvement of synapses on layer III neurons. Tetanus-induced LTP in this preparation was input specific, and was blocked by application of an NMDA receptor antagonist (but not by an antagonist of nitric oxide synthase). In addition, LTP of layer IV-evoked responses could also be produced reliably by pairing low-frequency synaptic stimulation (approximately 100 pulses at 1 Hz) with strong intracellular depolarization of layer III neurons. Thus, LTP in this circuit satisfies the definition of a "Hebbian" modification. Tetanic stimulation of the white matter, in sharp contrast, consistently failed to elicit LTP in layer III unless a GABAA receptor antagonist was applied to the slice. Analysis indicated that the critical difference between layer IV and white matter stimulation was not the magnitude of the responses to single stimuli delivered to the two sites, but that it might lie in the postsynaptic response during high-frequency stimulation. Consistent with this idea, "associative" LTP could be elicited from white matter when converging but independent inputs from the white matter and layer IV simultaneously received tetanic conditioning stimulation. A hypothetical model is presented to account for the differences between layer IV and white matter stimulation. According to this "plasticity gate hypothesis," inhibitory circuitry in layer IV normally acts as a sort of band-pass filter that constrains the types of activity patterns that can gain access to the modifiable synapses in layer III. By stimulating in layer IV, we have bypassed this filter and therefore do not need to block GABAA receptors to achieve the threshold for LTP in layer III.},

However, the causal link between these synaptic processes and memory has been difficult to demonstrate. Here we show that fear conditioning, a type of associative memory, can be inactivated and reactivated by LTD and LTP, respectively. We began by conditioning an animal to associate a foot shock with optogenetic stimulation of auditory inputs targeting the amygdala, a brain region known to be essential for fear conditioning. Subsequent optogenetic delivery of LTD conditioning to the auditory input inactivates memory of the shock. Then subsequent optogenetic delivery of LTP conditioning to the auditory input reactivates memory of the shock. Thus, we have engineered inactivation and reactivation of a memory using LTD and LTP, supporting a causal link between these synaptic processes and memory.},

Previous studies used chronic SSRI administration that may down-regulate 5-HTT and used the cerebellum as reference region despite measurable 5-HTT. We examine the reference region and occupancy after acute sertraline dosing. Methods: We conducted autoradiography of human postmortem cerebellum to determine an optimal reference region. We quantified 5-HTT binding using [11C]DASB and arterial input functions in 17 healthy volunteers. Baseline PET scans were followed by a scan 4-6 days after 25 mg to 100mg of daily sertraline. Several modeling methods and outcome measures were assessed. Results: Cerebellar gray matter is the optimal reference region. Occupation of 5-HTT sites saturates at low plasma sertraline levels (KD = 1.9 ng/ml) with maximal occupancies of 106.8 ?? 8.3{\%} across all brain regions. There is a weak correlation between oral sertraline and plasma sertraline. Occupancy measures vary based on the reference region and outcome measure used. Conclusions: Occupancy studies and postmortem autoradiography can help define the optimal reference region. Reference tissue modeling using the optimal reference region returns the same occupancy measures as those determined using an arterial input function. ?? 2005 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

Using optogenetics, we show that activation of a molecularly defined class of ipsilateral premotor interneurons elicits locomotion. These interneurons represent the excitatory module of the locomotor networks and are sufficient to produce a coordinated swimming pattern in zebrafish. They correspond to the V2a interneuron class and express the transcription factor Chx10. They produce sufficient excitatory drive within the spinal networks to generate coordinated locomotor activity. Therefore, our results define the V2a interneurons as the excitatory module within the spinal locomotor networks that is sufficient to initiate and maintain locomotor activity.},

abstract = {Negative cognitive bias-the tendency to interpret ambiguous situations pessimistically-is a central feature of stress-related disorders such as depression. The underlying neurobiology of this bias, however, remains unclear, not least because of a lack of translational tools. We established a new ambiguous-cue interpretation paradigm and, with respect to the etiology of depression, evaluated if environmental and genetic factors contribute to a negative bias. Rats were trained to press a lever to receive a food reward contingent to one tone and to press another lever in response to a different tone to avoid punishment by electric foot-shock. In the ambiguous-cue test, the lever-press responses to tones with frequencies intermediate to the trained tones were taken as indicators for the rats' expectation of a positive or negative event. A negative response bias because of decreased positive and increased negative responding was found in congenitally helpless rats, a genetic animal model of depression. Moreover, treatment with a combined noradrenergic-glucocorticoid challenge, mimicking stress-related changes in endogenous neuromodulation, biased rats away from positive responding. This response shift was accompanied by neuronal activation in dentate gyrus and amygdala. Thus, environmental and genetic risk factors for depression induce a response bias, which resembles the pessimistic bias of patients suffering from depression. The behavioral paradigm described constitutes a useful tool to study the neuronal basis of decision making under ambiguous conditions and may promote innovative pharmaco- and psychotherapy for depression.},

Testing the hypothesis that the mechanism of LTP maintenance stores information requires reversing this mechanism in vivo and finding out whether long-term stored information is lost. This was not previously possible. Recently however, persistent phosphorylation by the atypical protein kinase C isoform, protein kinase Mzeta (PKMz), has been found to maintain late LTP in hippocampal slices. Here we show that a cell-permeable PKMz inhibitor, injected in the rat hippocampus, both reverses LTP maintenance in vivo and produces persistent loss of 1-day-old spatial information. Thus, the mechanism maintaining LTP sustains spatial memory.},

Genetic engineering is an undoubtedly powerful technique; however, the value of this approach has been debated, particularly in relation to its use to probe the underlying bases of complex behaviors, such as memory. A recent new development of the technique is the ability to target a specific gene knockout to a particular subregion or even to specific and limited cell types of the mouse brain. An example of this approach is the knockout of the NMDARI gene in only CAI-pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. The resulting animals can be tested by several methods, including in vivo multielectrode recording during behavioral tasks. The data provide strong evidence in favor of the notion that NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity at CAI synapses is required for both the acquisition of spatial memory and the formation of normal CAI place fields. This relationship suggests that robust place fields may be essential for spatial memory.},

abstract = {Laminae I-III of the spinal dorsal horn contain many inhibitory interneurons that use GABA and/or glycine as a neurotransmitter. Distinct neurochemical populations can be recognised among these cells, and these populations are likely to have differing roles in inhibiting pain or itch. Quantitative studies in rat have shown that inhibitory interneurons account for 25-40{\%} of all neurons in this region. The sst2A receptor is expressed by around half the inhibitory interneurons in laminae I-II, and is associated with particular neurochemically-defined populations. Although much of the work on spinal pain mechanisms has been performed on rat, the mouse is now increasingly used as a model, due to the availability of genetically altered lines. However, quantitative information on the arrangement of interneurons is lacking in the mouse, and it is possible that there are significant species differences in neuronal organisation. In this study, we show that as in the rat, nearly all neurons in laminae I-III that are enriched with glycine also contain GABA, which suggests that GABA-immunoreactivity can be used to identify inhibitory interneurons in this region. These cells account for 26{\%} of the neurons in laminae I-II and 38{\%} of those in lamina III. As in the rat, the sst2A receptor is only expressed by inhibitory interneurons in laminae I-II, and is present on just over half (54{\%}) of these cells. Antibody against the neurokinin 1 receptor was used to define lamina I, and we found that although the receptor was concentrated in this lamina, it was expressed by many fewer cells than in the rat. By estimating the total numbers of neurons in each of these laminae in the L4 segment of the mouse, we show that there are around half as many neurons in each lamina as are present in the corresponding segment of the rat.},

abstract = {The initiation and coordination of activity in limb muscles are the main functions of neural circuits that control locomotion. Commissural neurons connect locomotor circuits on the two sides of the spinal cord, and represent the known neural substrate for left-right coordination. Here we demonstrate that a group of ipsilateral interneurons, V2a interneurons, plays an essential role in the control of left-right alternation. In the absence of V2a interneurons, the spinal cord fails to exhibit consistent left-right alternation. Locomotor burst activity shows increased variability, but flexor-extensor coordination is unaffected. Anatomical tracing studies reveal a direct excitatory input of V2a interneurons onto commissural interneurons, including a set of molecularly defined V0 neurons that drive left-right alternation. Our findings imply that the neural substrate for left-right coordination consists of at least two components; commissural neurons and a class of ipsilateral interneurons that activate commissural pathways. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background: Understanding how behaviors are generated by neural circuits requires knowledge of the synaptic connections between the composite neurons. Methods for mapping synaptic connections, such as electron microscopy and paired recordings, are labor intensive and alternative methods are thus desirable. New method: Development of a targeted GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners(GRASP) method, t-GRASP, for assessing neural connectivity is described. Results: Numerous different pre-synaptic and post-synaptic/dendritic proteins were tested for enhancing the specificity of GRASP signal to synaptic regions. Pairing of both targeted pre- and post-t-GRASP constructs resulted in strong preferential GRASP signal in synaptic regions in Drosophila larval sensory neurons, larval neuromuscular junctions, and adult photoreceptor neurons with minimal false-positive signal. Comparison with existing methods: Activity-independent t-GRASP exhibits an enhancement of GRASP signal specificity for synaptic contact sites as compared to existing Drosophila GRASP methods. Fly strains were developed for expression of both pre- and post-t-GRASP with each of the three Drosophila binary transcription systems, thus enabling GRASP assays to be performed between any two driver pairs of any transcription system in either direction, an option not available for existing Drosophila GRASP methods. Conclusions: t-GRASP is a novel targeted GRASP method for assessing synaptic connectivity between Drosophila neurons. Its flexibility of use with all three Drosophila binary transcription systems significantly expands the potential use of GRASP in Drosophila.},

abstract = {In response to starvation, eukaryotic cells recover nutrients through autophagy, a lysosomal-mediated process of cytoplasmic degradation. Autophagy is known to be inhibited by TOR signaling, but the mechanisms of autophagy regulation and its role in TOR-mediated cell growth are unclear. Here, we show that signaling through TOR and its upstream regulators PI3K and Rheb is necessary and sufficient to suppress starvation-induced autophagy in the Drosophila fat body. In contrast, TOR's downstream effector S6K promotes rather than suppresses autophagy, suggesting S6K downregulation may limit autophagy during extended starvation. Despite the catabolic potential of autophagy, disruption of conserved components of the autophagic machinery, including ATG1 and ATG5, does not restore growth to TOR mutant cells. Instead, inhibition of autophagy enhances TOR mutant phenotypes, including reduced cell size, growth rate, and survival. Thus, in cells lacking TOR, autophagy plays a protective role that is dominant over its potential role as a growth suppressor. ?? 2004 by Cell Press.},

This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates segregation and integration of parallel pathways.

abstract = {Short QT syndrome (SQTS) leads to an abbreviated QTc interval and predisposes patients to life-threatening arrhythmias. To date, two forms of the disease have been identified: SQT1, caused by a gain of function substitution in the HERG (I(Kr)) channel, and SQT2, caused by a gain of function substitution in the KvLQT1 (I(Ks)) channel. Here we identify a new variant, "SQT3", which has a unique ECG phenotype characterized by asymmetrical T waves, and a defect in the gene coding for the inwardly rectifying Kir2.1 (I(K1)) channel. The affected members of a single family had a G514A substitution in the KCNJ2 gene that resulted in a change from aspartic acid to asparagine at position 172 (D172N). Whole-cell patch-clamp studies of the heterologously expressed human D172N channel demonstrated a larger outward I(K1) than the wild-type (P{\textless}0.05) at potentials between -75 mV and -45 mV, with the peak current being shifted in the former with respect to the latter (WT, -75 mV; D172N, -65 mV). Coexpression of WT and mutant channels to mimic the heterozygous condition of the proband yielded an outward current that was intermediate between WT and D172N. In computer simulations using a human ventricular myocyte model the increased outward I(K1) greatly accelerated the final phase of repolarization, and shortened the action potential duration. Hence, unlike the known mutations in the two other SQTS forms (N588K in HERG and V307L in KvLQT1), simulations using the D172N and WT/D172N mutations fully accounted for the ECG phenotype of tall and asymmetrically shaped T waves. Although we were unable to test for inducibility of arrhythmia susceptibility due to lack of patients' consent, our computer simulations predict a steeper steady-state restitution curve for the D172N and WT/D172N mutation, compared with WT or to HERG or KvLQT1 mutations, which may predispose SQT3 patients to a greater risk of reentrant arrhythmias.},

abstract = {We describe the development and application of methods for high-throughput neuroanatomy in Drosophila using light microscopy. These tools enable efficient multicolor stochastic labeling of neurons at both low and high densities. Expression of multiple membrane-targeted and distinct epitope-tagged proteins is controlled both by a transcriptional driver and by stochastic, recombinase-mediated excision of transcription-terminating cassettes. This MultiColor FlpOut (MCFO) approach can be used to reveal cell shapes and relative cell positions and to track the progeny of precursor cells through development. Using two different recombinases, the number of cells labeled and the number of color combinations observed in those cells can be controlled separately. We demonstrate the utility of MCFO in a detailed study of diversity and variability of Distal medulla (Dm) neurons, multicolumnar local interneurons in the adult visual system. Similar to many brain regions, the medulla has a repetitive columnar structure that supports parallel information processing together with orthogonal layers of cell processes that enable communication between columns. We find that, within a medulla layer, processes of the cells of a given Dm neuron type form distinct patterns that reflect both the morphology of individual cells and the relative positions of their arbors. These stereotyped cell arrangements differ between cell types and can even differ for the processes of the same cell type in different medulla layers. This unexpected diversity of coverage patterns provides multiple independent ways of integrating visual information across the retinotopic columns and implies the existence of multiple developmental mechanisms that generate these distinct patterns.},

Associative learning can enhance their survival; however, until now it was unknown whether new neurons are involved in memory formation. Here we show that a substantial reduction in the number of newly generated neurons in the adult rat impairs hippocampal-dependent trace conditioning, a task in which an animal must associate stimuli that are separated in time. A similar reduction did not affect learning when the same stimuli are not separated in time, a task that is hippocampal-independent. The reduction in neurogenesis did not induce death of mature hippocampal neurons or permanently alter neurophysiological properties of the CA1 region, such as long-term potentiation. Moreover, recovery of cell production was associated with the ability to acquire trace memories. These results indicate that newly generated neurons in the adult are not only affected by the formation of a hippocampal-dependent memory, but also participate in it.},

abstract = {Physical features of sensory stimuli are fixed, but sensory perception is context dependent. The precise mechanisms that govern contextual modulation remain unknown. Here, we trained mice to switch between two contexts: passively listening to pure tones and performing a recognition task for the same stimuli. Two-photon imaging showed that many excitatory neurons in auditory cortex were suppressed during behavior, while some cells became more active. Whole-cell recordings showed that excitatory inputs were affected only modestly by context, but inhibition was more sensitive, with PV(+), SOM(+), and VIP(+) interneurons balancing inhibition and disinhibition within the network. Cholinergic modulation was involved in context switching, with cholinergic axons increasing activity during behavior and directly depolarizing inhibitory cells. Network modeling captured these findings, but only when modulation coincidently drove all three interneuron subtypes, ruling out either inhibition or disinhibition alone as sole mechanism for active engagement. Parallel processing of cholinergic modulation by cortical interneurons therefore enables context-dependent behavior.},

abstract = {Injection of formalin in the rat hindpaw produces two phases of nociceptive behavior. Although it is generally agreed that the first phase results from direct chemical activation of nociceptive primary afferent fibers, the factors that contribute to the second phase are not established. In the present study, we monitored the expression of the c-fos protein to evaluate whether the pattern of activity of dorsal horn neurons differs as a result of ongoing afferent activity during the two phases. To selectively block the first or second phase, we respectively used remifentanil, a potent and short acting opiate agonist, and QX-314, a quaternary derivative of lidocaine, which does not cross the blood brain barrier. We also evaluated the effect of eliminating nociceptive behavior in both phases using both remifentanil and lidocaine or a combination of local anesthetics, bupivicaine and quaternary lidocaine. In all groups, formalin (5{\%}, 50 ??l) was injected subcutaneously into the plantar surface of the hindpaw. To assess the nociceptive behavior produced by formalin, we monitored the number of flinches. Injection of remifentanil during the first phase completely blocked the first phase formalin-evoked nociceptive behavior, and had no effect on the second phase. Injection of lidocaine during the interphase completely blocked second phase nociceptive behavior. As expected, when remifentanil was administered during the first phase and lidocaine during the second phase, all formalin-evoked nociceptive behavior was blocked. The same was true for rats that received injections of bupivicaine and lidocaine during phases 1 and 2, respectively. In laminae I-II of the L4-L5 segment, the magnitude of the decrease in Fos expression was comparable for remifentanil (26.5{\%}) and lidocaine (27.3{\%}); the decrease was greater when both remifentanil and lidocaine were administered (50.5{\%}), and even greater when bupivicaine and lidocaine were used (74.2{\%}). In laminae V-VI, remifentanil, by itself, decreased c-fos expression by 39.4{\%}; for lidocaine alone, the decrease was 58.4{\%}. We did not observe further significant decreases when both remifentanil and lidocaine, or bupivacaine and lidocaine were injected (69.7{\%} and 74.6{\%}, respectively). Our results not only provide strong evidence that activity during the second phase is necessary for maintaining the maximal expression of c-fos in the spinal cord, but also reveal significant regional differences in the central patterns of activity generated during the two phases. These results also confirm our previous reports that c-fos expression is not eliminated when the behavioral manifestation of the noxious stimulus is completely blocked.},

The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is an ideal model for studying behavior because of its relatively small brain and the numerous sophisticated genetic tools that have been developed for this animal. Relatively recent technical advances allow the manipulation of a small subset of neurons with temporal resolution in flies while they are subject to behavior assays. This review briefly describes the most important genetic techniques, reagents, and approaches that are available to study and manipulate the neural circuits involved in Drosophila behavior. We also describe some examples of these genetic tools in the study of the olfactory receptor system.},

Theoretical studies have shown that synaptic plasticity allows a network to store a memory of patterns of activity such that they become attractors of the dynamics of the network. Here we study the properties of the excitatory synaptic connectivity in a network that maximizes the number of stored patterns of activity in a robust fashion. We show that the resulting synaptic connectivity matrix has the following properties: it is sparse, with a large fraction of zero synaptic weights (‘potential' synapses); bidirectionally coupled pairs of neurons are over-represented in comparison to a random network; and bidirectionally connected pairs have stronger synapses on average than unidirectionally connected pairs. All these features reproduce quantitatively available data on connectivity in cortex. This suggests synaptic connectivity in cortex is optimized to store a large number of attractor states in a robust fashion.},

Both chips were capable of significantly reducing the endogenous CNS movement while still allowing the study of sound-stimulated CNS activities of Drosophila 3rd instar larvae using genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP5. Temporal effects of sound frequency (50-5000 Hz) and intensity (95-115 dB) on CNS activities were investigated and a peak neuronal response of 200 Hz was identified. Our lab-on-chip devices can not only aid further studies of Drosophila larva's auditory responses but can be also adopted for functional imaging of CNS activities in response to other sensory cues. Auditory stimuli and the corresponding response of the CNS can potentially be used as a tool to study the effect of chemicals on the neurophysiology of this model organism.},

abstract = {When exposed to ionizing radiation (IR), eukaryotic cells activate checkpoint pathways to delay the progression of the cell cycle. Defects in the IR-induced S-phase checkpoint cause 'radioresistant DNA synthesis', a phenomenon that has been identified in cancer-prone patients suffering from ataxia-telangiectasia, a disease caused by mutations in the ATM gene. The Cdc25A phosphatase activates the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) needed for DNA synthesis, but becomes degraded in response to DNA damage or stalled replication. Here we report a functional link between ATM, the checkpoint signalling kinase Chk2/Cds1 (Chk2) and Cdc25A, and implicate this mechanism in controlling the S-phase checkpoint. We show that IR-induced destruction of Cdc25A requires both ATM and the Chk2-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc25A on serine 123. An IR-induced loss of Cdc25A protein prevents dephosphorylation of Cdk2 and leads to a transient blockade of DNA replication. We also show that tumour-associated Chk2 alleles cannot bind or phosphorylate Cdc25A, and that cells expressing these Chk2 alleles, elevated Cdc25A or a Cdk2 mutant unable to undergo inhibitory phosphorylation (Cdk2AF) fail to inhibit DNA synthesis when irradiated. These results support Chk2 as a candidate tumour suppressor, and identify the ATM-Chk2-Cdc25A-Cdk2 pathway as a genomic integrity checkpoint that prevents radioresistant DNA synthesis.},

In Drosophila, genetic defects in components of the insulin signaling pathway produce small flies that are delayed in development and possess fewer and smaller cells as well as female sterility, reminiscent of the phenotypes of starved flies. Results: Here we establish a causal link between nutrient availability and insulin-dependent growth. We show that in addition to the Drosophila insulin-like peptide 2 (dilp2) gene, overexpression of dilp1 and dilp3-7 is sufficient to promote growth. Three of the dilp genes are expressed in seven median neurosecretory cells (m-NSCs) in the brain. These m-NSCs possess axon terminals in the larval endocrine gland and on the aorta, from which DILPs may be released into the circulatory system. Although expressed in the same cells, the expression of the three genes is controlled by unrelated cis-regulatory elements. The expression of two of the three genes is regulated by nutrient availability. Genetic ablation of these neurosecretory cells mimics the phenotype of starved or insulin signaling mutant flies. Conclusions: These results point to a conserved role of the neuroendocrine axis in growth control in multicellular organisms.},

abstract = {Homeostatic mechanisms operate to stabilize synaptic function; however, we know little about how they are regulated. Exploiting . Drosophila genetics, we have uncovered a critical role for the target of rapamycin (TOR) in the regulation of synaptic homeostasis at the . Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction. Loss of postsynaptic TOR disrupts a retrograde compensatory enhancement in neurotransmitter release that is normally triggered by a reduction in postsynaptic glutamate receptor activity. Moreover, postsynaptic overexpression of TOR or a phosphomimetic form of S6 ribosomal protein kinase, a common target of TOR, can trigger a strong retrograde increase in neurotransmitter release. Interestingly, heterozygosity for . eIF4E, a critical component of the cap-binding protein complex, blocks the retrograde signal in all these cases. Our findings suggest that cap-dependent translation under the control of TOR plays a critical role in establishing the activity dependent homeostatic response at the NMJ. Haghighi et al. find that target of rapamycin (TOR), a major cellular enzyme known to integrate many intracellular and extracellular cues, is a regulator of synaptic homeostasis and stability in the nervous system. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Voltage-gated ion channels mediate electrical dynamics in excitable tissues and are an important class of drug targets. Channels can gate in sub-millisecond timescales, show complex manifolds of conformational states, and often show state-dependent pharmacology. Mechanistic studies of ion channels typically involve sophisticated voltage-clamp protocols applied through manual or automated electrophysiology. Here, we develop all-optical electrophysiology techniques to study activity-dependent modulation of ion channels, in a format compatible with high-throughput screening. Using optical electrophysiology, we recapitulate many voltage-clamp protocols and apply to Nav1.7, a channel implicated in pain. Optical measurements reveal that a sustained depolarization strongly potentiates the inhibitory effect of PF-04856264, a Nav1.7-specific blocker. In a pilot screen, we stratify a library of 320 FDA-approved compounds by binding mechanism and kinetics, and find close concordance with patch clamp measurements. Optical electrophysiology provides a favorable tradeoff between throughput and information content for studies of NaV channels, and possibly other voltage-gated channels.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP), a well-characterized form of synaptic plasticity, has long been postulated as a cellular correlate of learning and memory. Although LTP can persist for long periods of time, the mechanisms underlying LTP maintenance, in the midst of ongoing protein turnover and synaptic activity, remain elusive. Sustained activation of the brain-specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoform protein kinase M-zeta (PKM-zeta) has been reported to be necessary for both LTP maintenance and long-term memory. Inhibiting PKM-zeta activity using a synthetic zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) based on the PKC-zeta pseudosubstrate sequence reverses established LTP in vitro and in vivo. More notably, infusion of ZIP eliminates memories for a growing list of experience-dependent behaviours, including active place avoidance, conditioned taste aversion, fear conditioning and spatial learning. However, most of the evidence supporting a role for PKM-zeta in LTP and memory relies heavily on pharmacological inhibition of PKM-zeta by ZIP. To further investigate the involvement of PKM-zeta in the maintenance of LTP and memory, we generated transgenic mice lacking PKC-zeta and PKM-zeta. We find that both conventional and conditional PKC-zeta/PKM-zeta knockout mice show normal synaptic transmission and LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, and have no deficits in several hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tasks. Notably, ZIP still reverses LTP in PKC-zeta/PKM-zeta knockout mice, indicating that the effects of ZIP are independent of PKM-zeta.},

abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is thought to be an important cellular mechanism underlying memory formation. A widely accepted model posits that LTP requires the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail (C-tail) of the AMPA ($\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor subunit GluA1. To find the minimum necessary requirement of the GluA1 C-tail for LTP in mouse CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we used a single-cell molecular replacement strategy to replace all endogenous AMPA receptors with transfected subunits. In contrast to the prevailing model, we found no requirement of the GluA1 C-tail for LTP. In fact, replacement with the GluA2 subunit showed normal LTP, as did an artificially expressed kainate receptor not normally found at these synapses. The only conditions under which LTP was impaired were those with markedly decreased AMPA receptor surface expression, indicating a requirement for a reserve pool of receptors. These results demonstrate the synapse's remarkable flexibility to potentiate with a variety of glutamate receptor subtypes, requiring a fundamental change in our thinking with regard to the core molecular events underlying synaptic plasticity.},

@article{Pascoli2011,
abstract = {Drug-evoked synaptic plasticity is observed at many synapses and may underlie behavioural adaptations in addiction. Mechanistic investigations start with the identification of the molecular drug targets. Cocaine, for example, exerts its reinforcing and early neuroadaptive effects by inhibiting the dopamine transporter, thus causing a strong increase in mesolimbic dopamine. Among the many signalling pathways subsequently engaged, phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the nucleus accumbens is of particular interest because it has been implicated in NMDA-receptor and type 1 dopamine (D1)-receptor-dependent synaptic potentiation as well as in several behavioural adaptations. A causal link between drug-evoked plasticity at identified synapses and behavioural adaptations, however, is missing, and the benefits of restoring baseline transmission have yet to be demonstrated. Here we find that cocaine potentiates excitatory transmission in D1-receptor-expressing medium-sized spiny neurons (D1R-MSNs) in mice via ERK signalling with a time course that parallels locomotor sensitization. Depotentiation of cortical nucleus accumbens inputs by optogenetic stimulation in vivo efficiently restored normal transmission and abolished cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. These findings establish synaptic potentiation selectively in D1R-MSNs as a mechanism underlying a core component of addiction, probably by creating an imbalance between distinct populations of MSNs in the nucleus accumbens. Our data also provide proof of principle that reversal of cocaine-evoked synaptic plasticity can treat behavioural alterations caused by addictive drugs and may inspire novel therapeutic approaches involving deep brain stimulation or transcranial magnetic stimulation.},

Of course, it was not sufficient to guarantee that the consumption of these products should not mean risks for the health of the consumers. Because of the scientific interest in GM organisms (GMOs), as well as the great concern that the consumption of GM foods/plants has raised in a number of countries, I conducted two subsequent revisions (2007 and 2011) on the adverse/toxic effects of GM plants. In the present review, I have updated the information on the potential adverse health effects of GM plants consumed as food and/or feed. With only a few exceptions, the reported studies in the last six years show rather similar conclusions; that is to say, the assessed GM soybeans, rice, corn/maize and wheat would be as safe as the parental species of these plants. However, in spite of the notable increase in the available information, studies on the long-term health effects of GM plants, including tests of mutagenicity, teratogenicity and carcinogenicity seem to be still clearly necessary.},

abstract = {Antibody staining is a vital technique for studying the development of many model organisms, including Drosophila. Reliable protocols have long been available for antibody staining of Drosophila whole-mount embryos and dissected larvae. By contrast, methods for staining whole larvae have rarely been reported, are unreliable, and fail to work on large third-instar larvae. This has become a major limitation to understanding the role of multitissue interactions such as neural circuit formation and cell metastasis. We have modified existing embryo protocols to develop a reliable method for antibody staining of whole Drosophila larvae of any developmental stage. The procedure consists of a bleach wash, enzymatic digestion, first fixation, 'cracking', second fixation, (optional) Proteinase K (Pro-K) or sonication treatment, antibody staining, clearing, and mounting. The method takes longer than typical antibody stains of dissected larval tissues-12 or 16 d, depending on the size of the larvae, compared with 2-3 d for embryos or dissected tissue stains-but time is saved by eliminating the need for larval dissections and by allowing hundreds of larvae to be batch-processed. The method also works well for staining embryos, even late-stage embryos with cuticles, allowing characterization from early embryogenesis to the end of larval development.},

Although Ca2+ is known to mediate a diverse array of cell functions, it is not known whether oscillations contribute to the efficiency or specificity of signalling or are merely an inevitable consequence of the feedback control of [Ca2+]i. We have developed a Ca2+ clamp technique to investigate the roles of oscillation amplitude and frequency in regulating gene expression driven by the proinflammatory transcription factors NF-AT, Oct/OAP and NF-kappaB. Here we report that oscillations reduce the effective Ca2+ threshold for activating transcription factors, thereby increasing signal detection at low levels of stimulation. In addition, specificity is encoded by the oscillation frequency: rapid oscillations stimulate all three transcription factors, whereas infrequent oscillations activate only NF-kappaB. The genes encoding the cytokines interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-8 are also frequency-sensitive in a way that reflects their degree of dependence on NF-AT versus NF-kappaB. Our results provide direct evidence that [Ca2+]i oscillations increase both the efficacy and the information content of Ca2+ signals that lead to gene expression and cell differentiation.},

This widespread adoption has been largely fueled by the emergence of the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology, an important new approach for generating RNA-guided nucleases, such as Cas9, with customizable specificities. Genome editing mediated by these nucleases has been used to rapidly, easily and efficiently modify endogenous genes in a wide variety of biomedically important cell types and in organisms that have traditionally been challenging to manipulate genetically. Furthermore, a modified version of the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been developed to recruit heterologous domains that can regulate endogenous gene expression or label specific genomic loci in living cells. Although the genome-wide specificities of CRISPR-Cas9 systems remain to be fully defined, the power of these systems to perform targeted, highly efficient alterations of genome sequence and gene expression will undoubtedly transform biological research and spur the development of novel molecular therapeutics for human disease.},

abstract = {Two larval foraging strategies in Drosophila melanogaster were identified, "rover" and "sitter." "Rovers" traverse a large area while feeding whereas "sitters" cover a small area. The difference between "rovers" and "sitters" was analyzed genetically by chromosomal substitutions between isogenic stocks. Differences in larval locomotor behavior ("crawling behavior") can be attributed to the second chromosome, the "rover" strategy being dominant over the "sitter" strategy. Differences in feeding rate ("shoveling behavior") are affected additively by both the second and third chromosomes. Natural populations of Drosophila larvae were sampled three times over a 2-month period; "rovers" and "sitters" were at constant frequencies in these populations. The two foraging strategies are discussed in the light of resource utilization in environments where food is distributed continuously or discontinuously.},

abstract = {The primary sensory system requires the integrated function of multiple cell types, although its full complexity remains unclear. We used comprehensive transcriptome analysis of 622 single mouse neurons to classify them in an unbiased manner, independent of any a priori knowledge of sensory subtypes. Our results reveal eleven types: three distinct low-threshold mechanoreceptive neurons, two proprioceptive, and six principal types of thermosensitive, itch sensitive, type C low-threshold mechanosensitive and nociceptive neurons with markedly different molecular and operational properties. Confirming previously anticipated major neuronal types, our results also classify and provide markers for new, functionally distinct subtypes. For example, our results suggest that itching during inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis is linked to a distinct itch-generating type. We demonstrate single-cell RNA-seq as an effective strategy for dissecting sensory responsive cells into distinct neuronal types. The resulting catalog illustrates the diversity of sensory types and the cellular complexity underlying somatic sensation.},

However, the molecular mechanisms by which these receptors selectively interact with their cognate ligands remain poorly understood. There is growing evidence that many chemosensory receptors exist in multimeric complexes, though little is known about the relative contributions of individual subunits to receptor functions. Here, we report that each of the two subunits in the heteromeric T1R2:T1R3 sweet taste receptor binds sweet stimuli though with distinct affinities and conformational changes. Furthermore, ligand affinities for T1R3 are drastically reduced by the introduction of a single amino acid change associated with decreased sweet taste sensitivity in behaving mice. Thus, individual T1R subunits increase the receptive range of the sweet taste receptor, offering a functional mechanism for phenotypic variations in sweet taste.},

abstract = {The topographical retino-tectal projection of goldfish was electrophysiologically mapped at various intervals after surgical removal of the nasal half of the retina and pigment epithelium. The remaining projection was initially restricted to the appropriate rostral half of the tectum, even if the nerve was crushed and allowed to regenerate. But later, after 137 days or more, it showed a progressive expansion onto the foreign caudal half of the tectum. The magnification factor, the number of micrometers of tectum per degree in the visual field, doubled in the rostro-caudal but not in the medio-lateral direction. Analysis of the sequence of the expansion showed that a few fibers originally projecting nearest the denervated area were the first to spread over it. Then, progressively more fibers moved caudally until a nearly uniform representation of the half retina was established on the tectum. Radioautography also demonstrated that retinal fiber terminals had invaded the caudal tectum. The retinae of these fish were also examined histologically. The density of ganglion cells had not increased, but they consistently showed the axonal reaction. This was not found to be associated with any initial surgical trauma, but rather with the movement of their fiber terminals within the tectum. Frozen sections through half retinal and normal eyes, were cut and photographed for comparison of ocular geometry. Operated eyes were normal except for a slight but consistent loss of ocular volume. Analysis of the optical geometry showed that recording with fish in air produced two effects: Myopia (10 degrees blur circle, or less) and enlargement of the visual field by 15 percent to 20 percent.},

'Courtship genes' that seem to play more particular roles were originally identified as sensory, learning, or rhythm mutations; their reproductive abnormalities have been especially informative for revealing components of male or female actions that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. Further behavioral mutations seemed originally to be courtship-specific, turned out not to have that property, and have led to a broadened perspective on the nature and action of Drosophila's sex-determination genes.},

We describe and evaluate a method for identifying candidate interneurons and associated neuropile compartments that mediate Drosophila larval locomotion. We created Drosophila larvae that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a shibire(ts1) (shi(ts1)) transgene (a temperature-sensitive neuronal silencer) in small numbers of randomly selected cholinergic neurons. These larvae were screened for aberrant behavior at an elevated temperature (31-32°C). Among larvae with abnormal locomotion or sensory-motor responses, some had very small numbers of GFP-labeled temperature-sensitive interneurons. Labeled ascending interneurons projecting from the abdominal ganglia to specific brain neuropile compartments emerged as candidates for mediation of larval locomotion. Random targeting of small sets of neurons for functional evaluation, together with anatomical mapping of their processes, provides a tool for identifying the regions of the central nervous system that are required for normal locomotion. We discuss the limitations and advantages of this approach to discovery of interneurons that regulate motor behavior.},

abstract = {The gut microbiota affects a wide spectrum of host physiological traits, including development [1–5], germline [6], immunity [7–9], nutrition [4, 10, 11], and longevity [12, 13]. Association with microbes also influences fitness-related behaviors such as mating [14] and social interactions [15, 16]. Although the gut microbiota is evidently important for host wellbeing, how hosts become associated with particular assemblages of microbes from the environment remains unclear. Here, we present evidence that the gut microbiota can modify microbial and nutritional preferences of Drosophila melanogaster. By experimentally manipulating the gut microbiota of flies subjected to behavioral and chemosensory assays, we found that fly-microbe attractions are shaped by the identity of the host microbiota. Conventional flies exhibit preference for their associated Lactobacillus, a behavior also present in axenic flies as adults and marginally as larvae. By contrast, fly preference for Acetobacter is primed by early-life exposure and can override the innate preference. These microbial preferences are largely olfactory guided and have profound impact on host foraging, as flies continuously trade off between acquiring beneficial microbes and balancing nutrients from food. Our study shows a role of animal microbiota in shaping host fitness-related behavior through their chemosensory responses, opening a research theme on the interrelationships between the microbiota, host sensory perception, and behavior.},

We describe a technique called TRACT (TRAnsneuronal Control of Transcription) based on ligand-induced intramembrane proteolysis to reveal monosynaptic connections arising from genetically labeled neurons of interest. In this strategy, neurons expressing an artificial ligand ('donor' neurons) bind to and activate a genetically-engineered artificial receptor on their synaptic partners ('receiver' neurons). Upon ligand-receptor binding at synapses the receptor is cleaved in its transmembrane domain and releases a protein fragment that activates transcription in the synaptic partners. Using TRACT in Drosophila we have confirmed the connectivity between olfactory receptor neurons and their postsynaptic targets, and have discovered potential new connections between neurons in the circadian circuit. Our results demonstrate that the TRACT method can be used to investigate the connectivity of neuronal circuits in the brain.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Multifunctional motor systems produce distinct output patterns that are dependent on behavioral context, posing a challenge to underlying neuronal control. Flies use their wings for flight and the production of a patterned acoustic signal, the male courtship song, employing in both cases a small set of wing muscles and corresponding motor neurons. We took first steps toward elucidating the neuronal control mechanisms of this multifunctional motor system by live imaging of muscle ensemble activity patterns during song and flight, and we established the functional role of a comprehensive set of wing muscle motor neurons by silencing experiments. Song and flight rely on distinct configurations of neuromuscular activity, with most, but not all, flight muscles and their corresponding motor neurons contributing to song and shaping its acoustic parameters. The two behaviors are exclusive, and the neuronal command for flight overrides the command for song. The neuromodulator octopamine is a candidate for selectively stabilizing flight, but not song motor patterns. Flies use their wings for both flight and courtship song. The distinct motor output relies on different muscle and motor neuron operating modes. O'Sullivan et al. uncover the multiple motor neurons shaping song parameters, and they propose a new model of how flight-steering muscles are used in song and how neuromodulation affects the two behaviors.},

abstract = {We examined in rats the relationship between the ordering of retinal axons in the optic pathway and the formation of a retinotopically organized projection to their primary target, the contralateral superior colliculus (SC). We have previously found that axons labeled by focal injections of 1,1'-dioctadecyl 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) made in temporal or nasal retina of perinatal rats commonly mistarget along the medial-lateral and rostral-caudal axes of the SC. By postnatal day (P) 11-12, the retinocollicular projection attains an adult-like topography. Incorrectly targeted axons or axon segments are removed; axons that persist terminate in the topographically appropriate part of the SC (Simon and O'Leary: Dev Biol 137:125, 1990). In the present study, we made similar DiI injections, covering less than 2{\%} of the retinal area, in peripheral temporal, nasal, superior, or inferior retina, in rats of two age groups, embryonic day (E) 21 to P (postnatal day) 2 and P11-P17. Whole mounts of retina, optic nerve and tract, and SC, and cross sections of the optic nerve, were examined. In E21-P2 rats, retinal axons labeled from each retinal site are diffusely distributed in the SC, and poorly ordered in the optic pathway. In retina, labeled axons travel in fascicles directly from the injection site to the optic disc, but neighbor relationships begin to degrade as fascicles split and mix. Retinotopic order is virtually lost in the optic nerve; axons labeled from each injection site disperse throughout its cross-sectional area, but the labeled axons tend to be concentrated toward a specific half of the nerve depending upon their retinal origin. This slight tendency toward retinotopic order increases in the optic tract, but axons are still poorly ordered as they leave the tract and enter the SC. Targeting errors along the medial-lateral axis of the SC, but apparently not along its rostral-caudal axis, are related to the positioning of axons across the width of the optic tract. In P11-P17 rats, axons labeled from each injection site arborize only in a small, topographically correct part of the SC. However, the distributions of labeled retinal axons observed in whole mounts of the retina and optic pathway have a degree of disorder similar to those in E21-P2 rats. Further, the scatter of labeled axons in optic nerve cross sections is comparable in both age groups. Therefore, the emergence of topographic order in the retinocollicular projection is not accompanied by an emergence of a retinotopic ordering of axons in the optic nerve.},

abstract = {Compared to proprioceptive afferent collateral projections, less is known about the anatomical, neurochemical, and functional basis of nociceptive collateral projections modulating lumbar central pattern generators (CPG). Quick response times are critical to ensure rapid escape from aversive stimuli. Furthermore, sensitization of nociceptive afferent pathways can contribute to a pathological activation of motor circuits. We investigated the extent and role of collaterals of capsaicin-sensitive nociceptive sacrocaudal afferent (nSCA) nerves that directly ascend several spinal segments in Lissauer's tract and the dorsal column and regulate motor activity. Anterograde tracing demonstrated direct multisegmental projections of the sacral dorsal root 4 (S4) afferent collaterals in Lissauer's tract and in the dorsal column. Subsets of the traced S4 afferent collaterals expressed transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), which transduces a nociceptive response to capsaicin. Electrophysiological data revealed that S4 dorsal root stimulation could evoke regular rhythmic bursting activity, and our data suggested that capsaicin-sensitive collaterals contribute to CPG activation across multiple segments. Capsaicin's effect on S4-evoked locomotor activity was potent until the lumbar 5 (L5) segments, and diminished in rostral segments. Using calcium imaging we found elevated calcium transients within Lissauer's tract and dorsal column at L5 segments when compared to the calcium transients only within the dorsal column at the lumbar 2 (L2) segments, which were desensitized by capsaicin. We conclude that lumbar locomotor networks in the neonatal mouse spinal cord are targets for modulation by direct multisegmental nSCA, subsets of which express TRPV1 in Lissauer's tract and the dorsal column.

abstract = {Growth in normal and tumour cells is regulated by evolutionarily conserved extracellular inputs from the endocrine insulin receptor (InR) signalling pathway and by local nutrients. Both signals modulate activity of the intracellular TOR kinase, with nutrients at least partly acting through changes in intracellular amino acid levels mediated by amino acid transporters. We show that in Drosophila, two molecules related to mammalian proton-assisted SLC36 amino acid transporters (PATs), CG3424 and CG1139, are potent mediators of growth. These transporters genetically interact with TOR and other InR signalling components, indicating that they control growth by directly or indirectly modulating the effects of TOR signalling. A mutation in the CG3424 gene, which we have named pathetic (path), reduces growth in the fly. In a heterologous Xenopus oocyte system, PATH also activates the TOR target S6 kinase in an amino acid-dependent way. However, functional analysis reveals that PATH has an extremely low capacity and an exceptionally high affinity compared with characterised human PATs and the CG1139 transporter. PATH and potentially other PAT-related transporters must therefore control growth via a mechanism that does not require bulk transport of amino acids into the cell. As PATH is likely to be saturated in vivo, we propose that one specialised function of high-affinity PAT-related molecules is to maintain growth as local nutrient levels fluctuate during development.},

abstract = {Ca2+ signaling in nonexcitable cells is typically initiated by receptor-triggered production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores [1]. An elusive signaling process senses the Ca2+ store depletion and triggers the opening of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels [2-5]. The resulting sustained Ca2+ signals are required for many physiological responses, such as T cell activation and differentiation [6]. Here, we monitored receptor-triggered Ca2+ signals in cells transfected with siRNAs against 2,304 human signaling proteins, and we identified two proteins required for Ca 2+-store-depletion-mediated Ca2+ influx, STIM1 and STIM2 [7-9]. These proteins have a single transmembrane region with a putative Ca 2+ binding domain in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Ca 2+ store depletion led to a rapid translocation of STIM1 into puncta that accumulated near the plasma membrane. Introducing a point mutation in the STIM1 Ca2+ binding domain resulted in prelocalization of the protein in puncta, and this mutant failed to respond to store depletion. Our study suggests that STIM proteins function as Ca2+ store sensors in the signaling pathway connecting Ca2+ store depletion to Ca2+ influx. ??2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proper adjustment of moving direction after external mechanical stimulation is essential for animals to avoid danger (e.g. predators), and thus is vital for survival. This process involves sensory inputs, central processing and motor outputs. Recent studies have made considerable progress in identifying mechanosensitive neurons and mechanosensation receptor proteins. Our understandings of molecular and cellular mechanisms that link mechanosensation with the changes in moving direction, however, remain limited.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this study, we investigate the control of movement adjustment in Drosophila. In response to gentle touch at the anterior segments, Drosophila larvae reorient and select a new direction for forward movement. The extent of change in moving direction is correlated with the intensity of tactile stimuli. Sensation of gentle touch requires chordotonal organs and class IV da neurons. Genetic analysis indicates an important role for the evolutionarily conserved immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily protein Turtle (Tutl) to regulate touch-initiated directional change. Tutl is required specifically in post-mitotic neurons at larval stage after the completion of embryonic development. Circuit breaking analysis identified a small subset of Tutl-positive neurons that are involved in the adjustment of moving direction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We identify Tutl and a small subset of CNS neurons in modulating directional change in response to gentle touch. This study presents an excellent starting point for further dissection of molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling directional adjustment after mechanical stimulation.},

Trunk and limb muscles engage in distinctly lateralized behaviors, yet how regulatory spinal circuitry differs is less clear. Here, we intersect virus technology and mouse genetics to unravel striking distribution differences of interneurons connected to functionallydistinct motor neurons. We find that premotor interneurons conveying information to axial motor neurons reside in symmetrically balanced locations while mostly ipsilateral premotor interneurons synapse withlimb-innervating motor neurons, especially those innervating more distal muscles. We show that observed distribution differences reflect specific premotor interneuron subpopulations defined by genetic and neurotransmitter identity. Synaptic input across the midline reaches axial motor neurons preferentially through commissural axon arborization, and to a lesser extent, through midline-crossing dendrites capturing contralateral synaptic input. Together, our findings provide insight into principles of circuit organization underlying weighted lateralization of movement.},

To facilitate the identification of nerves and synapses in vivo, specific fluorescent protein markers can be used. For example, UASmCD8-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and UASmyr-red fluorescent protein (RFP) both preferentially label plasma membranes, whereas Discs large (DLG) reveals synapses.

abstract = {Establishing precise synaptic connectivity during development is crucial for neural circuit function. However, very few molecules have been identified that are involved in determining where and how many synapses form. The Plexin cell-surface molecules are a conserved family of axon guidance receptors that mediate axon fasciculation and repulsion during neural development, and later in development PlexinA receptors are involved in eliminating axonal branches and synapse numbers. Here we investigate the roles of PlexinA and PlexinB receptors in axonal branch and varicosity formation in Drosophila. We knocked down PlexinA or PlexinB expression using RNAi in identified mechanosensory neurons and analyzed axonal branching patterns and varicosity formations. Reducing PlexinA expression increased the axonal arbor complexity by increasing the number of branches and varicosities along the axon. In contrast, knocking down PlexinB expression decreased morphological complexity by decreasing the number of branches and the overall size of the axonal arbor, but did not reduce the number of varicosities. Our results demonstrate opposing roles for PlexinA and PlexinB in local wiring within a target region, where PlexinA functions to suppress excessive axonal branches and synapses and PlexinB facilitates axonal growth.},

In particular, we focus on the prospect of improving the lives of countless disabled individuals through a combination of BCI technology with existing assistive technologies (AT). In pursuit of more practical BCIs for use outside of the lab, in this paper, we identify four application areas where disabled individuals could greatly benefit from advancements in BCI technology, namely, "Communication and Control", "Motor Substitution", "Entertainment", and "Motor Recovery". We review the current state of the art and possible future developments, while discussing the main research issues in these four areas. In particular, we expect the most progress in the development of technologies such as hybrid BCI architectures, user-machine adaptation algorithms, the exploitation of users' mental states for BCI reliability and confidence measures, the incorporation of principles in human-computer interaction (HCI) to improve BCI usability, and the development of novel BCI technology including better EEG devices.},

We demonstrate that, in layer 5 of developing mouse visual cortex, preNMDARs specifically control synaptic transmission at pyramidal cell inputs to other pyramidal cells and to Martinotti cells, while leaving those to basket cells unaffected. We also reveal a type of interneuron that mediates ascending inhibition. In agreement with synapse-specific expression, we find preNMDAR-mediated calcium signals in a subset of pyramidal cell terminals. A tuned network model predicts that preNMDARs specifically reroute information flow in local circuits during high-frequency firing, in particular by impacting frequency-dependent disynaptic inhibition mediated by Martinotti cells, a finding that we experimentally verify. We conclude that postsynaptic cell type determines presynaptic terminal molecular identity and that preNMDARs govern information processing in neocortical columns.},

We additionally developed methods for utilizing optogenetic tools in freely moving rats and leveraged these technologies to clarify the causal relationship between dopamine (DA) neuron firing and positive reinforcement, observing that optical stimulation of DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of Th::. Cre rats is sufficient to support vigorous intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). These studies complement existing targeting approaches by extending the generalizability of optogenetics to traditionally non-genetically-tractable but vital animal models. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Complex as it is, much of the vast network of cellular functions has been success- fully dissected, on a microscopic scale, by the use of mutants in which one element is altered at a time. A similar approach may be fruitful in tackling the complex structures and events underlying behavior, using behavioral mutations to indicate modifications of the nervous system. Drosophila offers the same advantages to such a study as it did to classical genetics, namely, large numbers and short generation time, to which may now be added an enormous store of accumulated knowledge concerning the organism. Containing about 105 neurons, the fly's nervous system is roughly halfway, on a logarithmic scale, between a single neuron and the human brain, and the fly is possessed of a rich repertoire of behavior. The considerable literature on Drosophila behavior since Carpenter's 1905 paper' has recently been re- viewed by Manning.2 Multiple T-mazes and related devices have been used to fractionate populations according to their geotactic or phototactic responses, or spontaneous activity.3 This was pioneered by Hirsch and his colleagues,3 who started with a genetically heterogeneous pool obtained by mixing diverse wild strains and showed that pro- gressive selection yields strains showing hereditary changes in behavior. Such selection depends upon the recombination and additive effects of multiple genes that can prove quite difficult to disentangle. Since it is now possible to produce very high mutation rates in Drosophila, one can, instead, use an inbred strain and isolate mutants in which a behavioral change occurs by a single step, so that direct relationships between individual genes and the nervous system may be investigated. The method described here for fractionating populations is analogous to counter- current distribution,7 an eminently effective method of separating molecules from a mixture by their partition between two solvent phases. Using, instead, the relative preference of an organism for two behavioral alternatives, one obtains rapid, simultaneous measurements on many subjects. The present paper describes the procedure and the isolation of mutants showing changes in phototactic behavior.},

abstract = {Multiple brain regions respond to harmful nociceptive stimuli. However, it remains unclear as to whether behavioral avoidance of such stimuli can be modulated within the same or distinct brain networks. Here, we found subgroups of neurons localized within a well-defined brain region capable of mediating both innate and conditioned nociceptive avoidance in Drosophila. Neurons in the ventral, but not the dorsal, of the multiple-layer organized fan-shaped body (FB) are responsive to electric shock (ES). Silencing ES-responsive neurons, but not non-responsive neurons, leads to reduced avoidance of harmful stimuli, including ES and heat shock. Activating these neurons consistently triggers avoidance and can serve as an unconditional stimulus in an aversive classical conditioning task. Among the three groups of responsive neurons identified, two also have reduced activity in ES-conditioned odor avoidance. These results demonstrate that both innate and conditioned nociceptive avoidance might be represented within neurons confined to a single brain region. Regulation of innate and conditioned nociceptive avoidance is critical for animal survival. Hu et al. find that neurons in the fan-shaped body, a multiple-layer organized brain region, are highly responsive to harmful stimuli, including electric shock, and can regulate both innate and conditioned avoidance of such stimuli in Drosophila.},

@article{Stewart1988,
abstract = {The first adult case of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-OHSD) deficiency is described. The impaired conversion of cortisol to cortisone (indicated by urinary cortisol and cortisone metabolites and failure to metabolize 11 alpha-[3H]cortisol to [3H]H2O), was associated with hypertension, hypokalemia, and suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. When established on a fixed Na+/K+ intake, dexamethasone, given orally, produced a natriuresis and potassium retention. Plasma renin activity became detectable. When hydrocortisone (10 mg daily s.c. for 4 d) was added, there was marked Na+ retention, a kaliuresis (urinary Na+/K+ falling from 1.2 to 0.15), with suppression of plasma renin activity and an increase in blood pressure. These changes were also seen with the subject on no treatment. Conversion of cortisone to cortisol was not affected. These results suggest that cortisol acts as a potent mineralocorticoid in 11 beta-OHSD deficiency. The major site for the oxidation of cortisol to cortisone is the kidney. In this patient congenital deficiency of 11 beta-OHSD results in high intrarenal cortisol levels which then act on renal type I mineralocorticoid receptors. This condition can be treated with dexamethasone, which suppresses cortisol secretion and binds to the type II glucocorticoid receptor. We suggest that 11 beta-OHSD exerts a critical paracrine role in determining the specificity of the type I receptor. In the normal state cortisol is converted by 11 beta-OHSD to cortisone which thus allows aldosterone to bind preferentially to the type I receptors in the kidney and gut. In this patient deficiency of 11 beta-OHSD results in high intrarenal cortisol concentrations that then bind to the type I receptor.},

Misregulated CDKs induce unscheduled proliferation as well as genomic and chromosomal instability. According to current models, mammalian CDKs are essential for driving each cell cycle phase, so therapeutic strategies that block CDK activity are unlikely to selectively target tumour cells. However, recent genetic evidence has revealed that, whereas CDK1 is required for the cell cycle, interphase CDKs are only essential for proliferation of specialized cells. Emerging evidence suggests that tumour cells may also require specific interphase CDKs for proliferation. Thus, selective CDK inhibition may provide therapeutic benefit against certain human neoplasias.},

abstract = {Previous findings of time-of-day differences in athletic performance could be confounded by diurnal fluctuations in environmental and behavioral "masking" factors (e.g., sleep, ambient temperature, and energy intake). The purpose of this study was to examine whether there is a circadian rhythm in swim performance that is independent of these masking factors. Experienced swimmers (n = 25) were assessed for 50-55 consecutive hours in the laboratory. The swimmers followed a 3-h "ultra-short" sleep-wake cycle, involving 1 h of sleep in darkness and 2 h of wakefulness in dim light, that was repeated throughout the observation. The protocol distributes behavioral and environmental masking factors equally across the 24-h period. Each swimmer was scheduled to perform six maximal-effort 200-m swim trials that were distributed equally across eight times of day (n = 147 trials). Each trial was separated by 9 h. A cosine fit of intra-aural temperature data established the time of the lowest body temperature (Tmin). Swim performances were z-transformed and compared across the eight times of day and across twelve 2-h intervals relative to Tmin. Analysis of covariance, controlling for trial number, revealed a significant (P {\textless} 0.001) pattern in swim performance relative to environmental and circadian times of day. Performance peaked 5-7 h before Tmin (approximately 2300) and was worst from 1 h before to 1 h after Tmin (approximately 0500). Mean swim performance was 169.5 s; circadian variation from peak to worst performance was 5.8 s. These data suggest a circadian rhythm in athletic performance independent of environmental and behavioral masking effects.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity causes the rapid expression of immediate early genes that are crucial for experience-driven changes to synapses, learning, and memory. Here, using both molecular and genome-wide next-generation sequencing methods, we report that neuronal activity stimulation triggers the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in the promoters of a subset of early-response genes, including Fos, Npas4, and Egr1. Generation of targeted DNA DSBs within Fos and Npas4 promoters is sufficient to induce their expression even in the absence of an external stimulus. Activity-dependent DSB formation is likely mediated by the type II topoisomerase, Topoisomerase II?? (Topo II??), and knockdown of Topo II?? attenuates both DSB formation and early-response gene expression following neuronal stimulation. Our results suggest that DSB formation is a physiological event that rapidly resolves topological constraints to early-response gene expression in neurons. PaperClip},

During chemotaxis in the Drosophila melanogaster larva, the detection of positive odor gradients extends runs while negative gradients promote stops and turns. This algorithm represents a foundation for the control of sensory navigation across phyla. In the present work, we identified an olfactory descending neuron, PDM-DN, which plays a pivotal role in the organization of stops and turns in response to the detection of graded changes in odor concentrations. Artificial activation of this descending neuron induces deterministic stops followed by the initiation of turning maneuvers through head casts. Using electron microscopy, we reconstructed the main pathway that connects the PDM-DN neuron to the peripheral olfactory system and to the pre-motor circuit responsible for the actuation of forward peristalsis. Our results set the stage for a detailed mechanistic analysis of the sensorimotor conversion of graded olfactory inputs into action selection to perform goal-oriented navigation.},

Reciprocal inhibition produces alternating motor patterns; however, the mechanismsthat generate other phasic relationships between intrasegmental motor pools are unknown. Here, we investigate one such motor pattern in the Drosophila larva, using a multidisciplinary approach including electrophysiology and ssTEM-based cir- cuit reconstruction. We find that two motor pools that are sequentially recruited during locomotion have identical excitable properties. In contrast, they receive input from divergent premotor circuits. We find that this motor pattern is not orchestrated by differential excitatory input but by a GABAergic inter- neuron acting as a delay line to the later-recruited motor pool. Our findings show how a motor pattern is generated as a function of the modular organiza- tion of locomotor networks through segregation of inhibition, a potentially general mechanism for sequential motor patterns.},

Contrary to previous speculation, this new structure suggests a mechanistic model in which rotational 'twist' of the cytoplasmic domain is coupled to opening of the bundle-crossing gate through a network of inter- and intrasubunit interactions that involve the TM2 C-linker, slide helix, G-loop and the CD loop.},

Although much is known about the neural processing of sensory information, how the aversive or attractive sensory stimulus is transformed through central brain neurons into avoidance or approaching behavior is largely unclear. Here we show that Drosophila larval light preference behavior is regulated by a disinhibitory mechanism. In the disinhibitory circuit, a pair of GABAergic neurons exerts tonic inhibition on one pair of contralateral projecting neurons that control larval reorientation behavior. When a larva enters the light area, the reorientation-controlling neurons are disinhibited to allow reorientation to occur as the upstream inhibitory neurons are repressed by light. When the larva exits the light area, the inhibition on the downstream neurons is restored to repress further reorientation and thus prevents the larva from re-entering the light area. We suggest that disinhibition may serve as a common neural mechanism for animal innate preference behavior.},

Two other articles report magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein and then tugging the ferritin or heating it with a magnetic field (Stanley et al., 2015; Wheeler et al., 2016). Here I argue that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics. The discrepancies are large: from 5 to 10 log units. If the reported phenomena do in fact occur, they must have causes entirely different from the ones proposed by the authors. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes is found to seriously limit their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells.},

abstract = {Axons from the retina traverse different molecular territories as they navigate to the tectum. A single territory might span only a few cell diameters and harbour multiple guidance cues, many of which are beginning to be characterized. Also present in the pathway are 'modulators' that influence a growth cone's response to a coincident signal but do not guide growth directly. An emerging principle is that the growth cone, itself, changes molecularly as it journeys through the visual pathway. Growing retinal axons contain mRNAs, ubiquitinating and apoptotic enzymes, translation and degradation machinery. Guidance cues can trigger rapid and local synthesis, degradation and endocytosis of proteins, providing a fast and flexible way for growth cones to respond to cues in their microenvironment and to alter their responsiveness. The data raise the idea that the localized synthesis and downregulation of proteins might help to steer retinal axon growth and, further, might contribute to the changing character of a growth cone as it ages.},

abstract = {In order to understand how nociceptive information is processed in the spinal dorsal horn we need to unravel the complex synaptic circuits involving interneurons, which constitute the vast majority of the neurons in laminae I-III. The main limitation has been the difficulty in defining functional populations among these cells. We have recently identified 4 non-overlapping classes of inhibitory interneuron, defined by expression of galanin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and parvalbumin, in the rat spinal cord. In this study we demonstrate that these form distinct functional populations that differ in terms of sst2A receptor expression and in their responses to painful stimulation. The sst2A receptor was expressed by nearly all of the nNOS- and galanin-containing inhibitory interneurons but by few of those with NPY and none of the parvalbumin cells. Many galanin- and NPY-containing cells exhibited phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (pERK) after mechanical, thermal or chemical noxious stimuli, but very few nNOS-containing cells expressed pERK after any of these stimuli. However, many nNOS-positive inhibitory interneurons up-regulated Fos after noxious thermal stimulation or injection of formalin, but not after capsaicin injection. Parvalbumin cells did not express either activity-dependent marker following any of these stimuli. These results suggest that interneurons belonging to the NPY, nNOS and galanin populations are involved in attenuating pain, and for NPY and nNOS cells this is likely to result from direct inhibition of nociceptive projection neurons. They also suggest that the nociceptive inputs to the nNOS cells differ from those to the galanin and NPY populations.},

abstract = {Little is known about the organization of central circuits by which external and internal sensory inputs act on motor outputs to regulate fundamental behaviors such as feeding. We reconstructed, from a whole CNS EM volume, the synaptic map of input and output neurons that underlie food intake behavior of Drosophila larvae. The input neurons originate from enteric, pharyngeal and external sensory organs and converge onto seven distinct sensory synaptic compartments within the CNS, as defined by distribution patterns of their presynaptic sites. The output neurons consist of pharyngeal motor neurons, serotonergic modulatory neurons, and neuroendocrine neurons that target the ring gland, a key endocrine organ. Monosynaptic connections from a set of sensory synaptic compartments cover the motor and endocrine targets in overlapping domains. Polysynaptic routes can be superimposed on top of the monosynaptic connections, resulting in divergent sensory paths that converge on common motor outputs. A completely different set of sensory compartments is connected to the mushroom body calyx of the memory circuits. Our results illustrate a circuit architecture in which monosynaptic and multisyn-aptic connections from sensory inputs traverse onto output neurons via a series of converging paths.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated sodium (Na(V)) channels initiate electrical signalling in excitable cells and are the molecular targets for drugs and disease mutations, but the structural basis for their voltage-dependent activation, ion selectivity and drug block is unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of a voltage-gated Na(+) channel from Arcobacter butzleri (NavAb) captured in a closed-pore conformation with four activated voltage sensors at 2.7 {\AA} resolution. The arginine gating charges make multiple hydrophilic interactions within the voltage sensor, including unanticipated hydrogen bonds to the protein backbone. Comparisons to previous open-pore potassium channel structures indicate that the voltage-sensor domains and the S4-S5 linkers dilate the central pore by pivoting together around a hinge at the base of the pore module. The NavAb selectivity filter is short, ∼4.6 {\AA} wide, and water filled, with four acidic side chains surrounding the narrowest part of the ion conduction pathway. This unique structure presents a high-field-strength anionic coordination site, which confers Na(+) selectivity through partial dehydration via direct interaction with glutamate side chains. Fenestrations in the sides of the pore module are unexpectedly penetrated by fatty acyl chains that extend into the central cavity, and these portals are large enough for the entry of small, hydrophobic pore-blocking drugs. This structure provides the template for understanding electrical signalling in excitable cells and the actions of drugs used for pain, epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia at the atomic level.},

abstract = {The circadian clock in the mammalian hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is entrained by the ambient light/dark cycle, which differentially acts to cause the clock to advance or delay. Light-induced changes in the rhythmic expression of SCN clock genes are believed to be a critical step in this process, but how the two entrainment modalities--advances vs. delays--engage the molecular clockwork remains incompletely understood. We investigated molecular substrates of photic entrainment of the clock in the SCN by stably entraining hamsters to T cycles (non-24-h light/dark cycles) consisting of a single 1-h light pulse repeated as either a short (23.33-h) or a long (24.67-h) cycle; under these conditions, the light pulse of the short cycle acts as "dawn," whereas that of the long cycle acts as "dusk." Analyses of the expression of the photoinducible and rhythmic clock genes Period 1 and 2 (Per1 and Per2) in the SCN revealed fundamental differences under these two entrainment modes. Light at dawn advanced the clock, advancing the onset of the Per1 mRNA rhythm and acutely increasing mRNA transcription, whereas light at dusk delayed the clock, delaying the offset of the Per2 mRNA rhythm and tonically increasing mRNA stability. The results suggest that the underlying molecular mechanisms of circadian entrainment differ with morning (advancing) or evening (delaying) light exposure, and such differences may reflect how entrainment takes place in nocturnal animals under natural conditions.},

abstract = {Variation was measured in samples of populations of species from four plant families including tropical, temperate and cosmopolitan taxa. Populations of species of Asclepiadaceae, Bromeliaceae, Leguminosae and Umbelliferae were sampled. Employing a simple application of numerical phenetics and tested character lists, estimates of within-group overall variation were made. The coefficients of phenetic variation (CPV) are compared among the various groups. The groups considered are populations as well as taxa at several levels in the classification hierarchy, although in all cases, individuals sampled randomly from putative populations are the operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A small number of individuals is employed with a large number of characters. This application of numerical phenetics serves both alpha taxonomic and biosystematic goals and an OTU x OTU matrix of distance values is the basis for obtaining estimates of a population's variability. The phenetic distances between OTUs are the variates. Distinct trends of within-group variation are consistent as they were revealed in the four families. Intrapopulational coefficient of phenetic variation for populations of the tropical family Bromeliaceae is estimated as nearly double that for the other three families. The intraspecific variation as portrayed by CPV in the Asclepiadaceae and Leguminosae is about half that for the tropical family, Bromeliaceae. As sampled a clear distinction is evidenced in the change in variation between various taxonomic ranks for the families. The difference in CPV between the intrapopulational and intraspecific levels for the Leguminosae and Bromeliaceae is nearly double the difference between these two ranks for the Asclepiadaceae. Results show that the method has descriptive and heuristic value for systematics.},

abstract = {The brain receives sensory input from diverse peripheral tissues, including the skin, the body's largest sensory organ. Using genetically encoded axonal tracers expressed from the Mrgprd locus, we identify a subpopulation of nonpeptidergic, nociceptive neurons that project exclusively to the skin, and to no other peripheral tissue examined. Surprisingly, Mrgprd+ innervation is restricted to the epidermis and absent from specialized sensory structures. Furthermore, Mrgprd+ fibers terminate in a specific layer of the epidermis, the stratum granulosum. This termination zone is distinct from that innervated by most CGRP+ neurons, revealing that peptidergic and nonpeptidergic epidermal innervation is spatially segregated. The central projections deriving from these distinct epidermal innervation zones terminate in adjacent laminae in the dorsal spinal cord. Thus, afferent input from different layers of the epidermis is conveyed by topographically segregated sensory circuits, suggesting that at least some aspects of sensory information processing may be organized along labeled lines.},

To understand their applied properties so that they can be optimally deployed, we compared the recombinases FLP and Cre in two assays. In both Escherichia coil and in vitro, FLP shows a different temperature optimum than Cre. FLP is more thermolabile, having an optimum near 30°C and little detectable activity above 39°C. Cre is optimally efficient at 37°C and above. Consistent with FLP thermolability, recombination in a mammalian cell line mediated by a ligand- regulated FLP-androgen receptor fusion protein is more efficient at 35°C than at higher temperatures. We also document a mutation in a commercially available FLP plasmid (FLP-F70L) which renders this recombinase even more thermolabile. The different temperature optima of FLP, FLP-F7OL and Cre influence their strategies of usage. Our results recommend the use of Cre for applications in mice that require efficient recombination. The thermolabilities of FLP and FLP-F7OL can be usefully exploited for gain of function and cell culture applications.},

abstract = {Nociceptor inputs can trigger a prolonged but reversible increase in the excitability and synaptic efficacy of neurons in central nociceptive pathways, the phenomenon of central sensitization. Central sensitization manifests as pain hypersensitivity, particularly dynamic tactile allodynia, secondary punctate or pressure hyperalgesia, aftersensations, and enhanced temporal summation. It can be readily and rapidly elicited in human volunteers by diverse experimental noxious conditioning stimuli to skin, muscles or viscera, and in addition to producing pain hypersensitivity, results in secondary changes in brain activity that can be detected by electrophysiological or imaging techniques. Studies in clinical cohorts reveal changes in pain sensitivity that have been interpreted as revealing an important contribution of central sensitization to the pain phenotype in patients with fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, musculoskeletal disorders with generalized pain hypersensitivity, headache, temporomandibular joint disorders, dental pain, neuropathic pain, visceral pain hypersensitivity disorders and postsurgical pain. The comorbidity of those pain hypersensitivity syndromes that present in the absence of inflammation or a neural lesion, their similar pattern of clinical presentation and response to centrally acting analgesics, may reflect a commonality of central sensitization to their pathophysiology. An important question that still needs to be determined is whether there are individuals with a higher inherited propensity for developing central sensitization than others, and if so, whether this conveys an increased risk both of developing conditions with pain hypersensitivity, and their chronification. Diagnostic criteria to establish the presence of central sensitization in patients will greatly assist the phenotyping of patients for choosing treatments that produce analgesia by normalizing hyperexcitable central neural activity. We have certainly come a long way since the first discovery of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the spinal cord and the revelation that it occurs and produces pain hypersensitivity in patients. Nevertheless, discovering the genetic and environmental contributors to and objective biomarkers of central sensitization will be highly beneficial, as will additional treatment options to prevent or reduce this prevalent and promiscuous form of pain plasticity.},

abstract = {Receptor desensitization is a universal mechanism to turn off a biological response; in this process, the ability of a physiological trigger to activate a cell is lost despite the continued presence of the stimulus. Receptor desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors involves uncoupling of the receptor from its G-protein or second-messenger pathway followed by receptor internalization. G-protein-coupled cysteinyl leukotriene type I (CysLT1) receptors regulate immune-cell function and CysLT1 receptors are an established therapeutic target for allergies, including asthma. Desensitization of CysLT1 receptors arises predominantly from protein-kinase-C-dependent phosphorylation of three serine residues in the receptor carboxy terminus. Physiological concentrations of the receptor agonist leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) evoke repetitive cytoplasmic Ca(2+) oscillations, reflecting regenerative Ca(2+) release from stores, which is sustained by Ca(2+) entry through store-operated calcium-release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels. CRAC channels are tightly linked to expression of the transcription factor c-fos, a regulator of numerous genes important to cell growth and development. Here we show that abolishing leukotriene receptor desensitization suppresses agonist-driven gene expression in a rat cell line. Mechanistically, stimulation of non-desensitizing receptors evoked prolonged inositol-trisphosphate-mediated Ca(2+) release, which led to accelerated Ca(2+)-dependent slow inactivation of CRAC channels and a subsequent loss of excitation-transcription coupling. Hence, rather than serving to turn off a biological response, reversible desensitization of a Ca(2+) mobilizing receptor acts as an 'on' switch, sustaining long-term signalling in the immune system.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms involved in long-term potentiation (LTP) should provide insights into the cellular and molecular basis of learning and memory in vertebrates. It has been established that in the CA1 region of the hippocampus the induction of LTP requires the transient activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor system. During low-frequency transmission, significant activation of this system is prevented by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediated synaptic inhibition which hyperpolarizes neurons into a region where NMDA receptor-operated channels are substantially blocked by Mg2+ (refs. 5, 6). But during high-frequency transmission, mechanisms are evoked that provide sufficient depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane to reduce this block and thereby permit the induction of LTP. We now report that this critical depolarization is enabled because during high-frequency transmission GABA depresses its own release by an action on GABAB autoreceptors, which permits sufficient NMDA receptor activation for the induction of LTP. These findings demonstrate a role for GABAB receptors in synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {Neuronal circuit mapping using electron microscopy demands laborious proofreading or reconciliation of multiple independent reconstructions. Here, we describe new methods to apply quantitative arbor and network context to iteratively proofread and reconstruct circuits and create anatomically enriched wiring diagrams. We measured the morphological underpinnings of connectivity in new and existing reconstructions of Drosophila sensorimotor (larva) and visual (adult) systems. Synaptic inputs were preferentially located on numerous small, microtubule-free 'twigs' which branch off a single microtubule-containing 'backbone'. Omission of individual twigs accounted for 96{\%} of errors. However, the synapses of highly connected neurons were distributed across multiple twigs. Thus, the robustness of a strong connection to detailed twig anatomy was associated with robustness to reconstruction error. By comparing iterative reconstruction to the consensus of multiple reconstructions, we show that our method overcomes the need for redundant effort through the discovery and application of relationships between cellular neuroanatomy and synaptic connectivity.},

abstract = {One of the limitations on imaging fluorescent proteins within living cells is that they are usually present in small numbers and need to be detected over a large background. We have developed the means to isolate specific fluorescence signals from background by using lock-in detection of the modulated fluorescence of a class of optical probe termed "optical switches." This optical lock-in detection (OLID) approach involves modulating the fluorescence emission of the probe through deterministic, optical control of its fluorescent and nonfluorescent states, and subsequently applying a lock-in detection method to isolate the modulated signal of interest from nonmodulated background signals. Cross-correlation analysis provides a measure of correlation between the total fluorescence emission within single pixels of an image detected over several cycles of optical switching and a reference waveform detected within the same image over the same switching cycles. This approach to imaging provides a means to selectively detect the emission from optical switch probes among a larger population of conventional fluorescent probes and is compatible with conventional microscopes. OLID using nitrospirobenzopyran-based probes and the genetically encoded Dronpa fluorescent protein are shown to generate high-contrast images of specific structures and proteins in labeled cells in cultured and explanted neurons and in live Xenopus embryos and zebrafish larvae.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, a rise in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) can activate a plethora of responses that operate on time scales ranging from milliseconds to days. Inherent to the use of a promiscuous signal like Ca(2+) is the problem of specificity: how can Ca(2+) activate some responses but not others? We now know that the spatial profile of the Ca(2+) signal is important Ca(2+) does not simply rise uniformly throughout the cytoplasm upon stimulation but can reach very high levels locally, creating spatial gradients. The most fundamental local Ca(2+) signal is the Ca(2+) microdomain that develops rapidly near open plasmalemmal Ca(2+) channels like voltage-gated L-type (Cav1.2) and store-operated CRAC channels. Recent work has revealed that Ca(2+) microdomains arising from these channels are remarkably versatile in triggering a range of responses that differ enormously in both temporal and spatial profile. Here, I delineate basic features of Ca(2+) microdomains and then describe how these highly local signals are used by Ca(2+)-permeable channels to drive cellular responses.},

abstract = {Neurons establish diverse dendritic morphologies during development, and a major challenge is to understand how these distinct developmental programs might relate to, and influence, neuronal function. Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons display class-specific dendritic morphology with extensive coverage of the body wall. To begin to build a basis for linking dendrite structure and function in this genetic system, we analyzed da neuron axon projections in embryonic and larval stages. We found that multiple parameters of axon morphology, including dorsoventral position, midline crossing and collateral branching, correlate with dendritic morphological class. We have identified a class-specific medial-lateral layering of axons in the central nervous system formed during embryonic development, which could allow different classes of da neurons to develop differential connectivity to second-order neurons. We have examined the effect of Robo family members on class-specific axon lamination, and have also taken a forward genetic approach to identify new genes involved in axon and dendrite development. For the latter, we screened the third chromosome at high resolution in vivo for mutations that affect class IV da neuron morphology. Several known loci, as well as putative novel mutations, were identified that contribute to sensory dendrite and/or axon patterning. This collection of mutants, together with anatomical data on dendrites and axons, should begin to permit studies of dendrite diversity in a combined developmental and functional context, and also provide a foundation for understanding shared and distinct mechanisms that control axon and dendrite morphology.},

In Brief Cui et al. identify a new population of spinal cord deep dorsal horn ''gating'' neurons that mediates crosstalk between touch and pain pathways. Activation or ablation of these early RET+ neurons highlights critical roles in basal and pathological pain states. SUMMARY The gate control theory (GCT) of pain proposes that pain-and touch-sensing neurons antagonize each other through spinal cord dorsal horn (DH) gating neurons. However, the exact neural circuits underly-ing the GCT remain largely elusive. Here, we identi-fied a new population of deep layer DH (dDH) inhibi-tory interneurons that express the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret neonatally. These early RET+ dDH neu-rons receive excitatory as well as polysynaptic inhib-itory inputs from touch-and/or pain-sensing affer-ents. In addition, they negatively regulate DH pain and touch pathways through both pre-and postsyn-aptic inhibition. Finally, specific ablation of early RET+ dDH neurons increases basal and chronic pain, whereas their acute activation reduces basal pain perception and relieves inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Taken together, our findings un-cover a novel spinal circuit that mediates crosstalk between touch and pain pathways and suggest that some early RET+ dDH neurons could function as pain ''gating'' neurons.},

abstract = {Current models describe male-specific fruitless (fruM) as a genetic 'switch' regulating sexual behavior in Drosophila melanogaster, and they postulate that female (F) and male (M) doublesex (dsx) products control body sexual morphology. In contradiction to this simple model, we show that dsx, as well as fruM and non-sex-specific retained (retn), affect both male and female sexual behaviors. In females, both retn and dsxF contribute to female receptivity, and both genes act to repress male-like courtship activity in the presence or absence of fruM. In males, consistent with the opposing functions of dsxM and dsxF, dsxM acts as a positive factor for male courtship. retn also acts counter to fruM in the development of the male-specific muscle of Lawrence. Molecularly, retn seems to regulate sexual behavior via a previously described complex that represses zerknullt. Thus, we show that fru and dsx together act as a 'switch' system regulating behavior in the context of other developmental genes, such as retn.},

We have determined a crystal structure of the full-length channel at a resolution of 3.2 A, and of the isolated voltage-sensor domain at 1.9 A, both in complex with monoclonal Fab fragments. The channel contains a central ion-conduction pore surrounded by voltage sensors, which form what we call 'voltage-sensor paddles'-hydrophobic, cationic, helix-turn-helix structures on the channel's outer perimeter. Flexible hinges suggest that the voltage-sensor paddles move in response to membrane voltage changes, carrying their positive charge across the membrane.},

While such systems perform well during acute recordings, they often fail to function reliably in clinically relevant chronic settings. Available evidence suggests that a major failure mode of electrode arrays is the brain tissue reaction against these implants, making the biocompatibility of implanted electrodes a primary concern in device design. This review presents the biological components and time course of the acute and chronic tissue reaction in brain tissue, analyses the brain tissue response of current electrode systems, and comments on the various material science and bioactive strategies undertaken by electrode designers to enhance electrode performance. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Different strategies of decision support can be identified in a consultation process and implemented in an expert system. This paper concentrates on experiments that were carried out with an expert system that was developed in the area of information retrieval, to perform the job of an information specialist who assists users in selecting query terms for database searches. Three different support strategies are utilized in the system. One is a “participative” strategy, in which the system performs a search within its knowledge base and during which there is interaction between the system and the user, whereby the system informs the user of intermediate findings and the user judges their relevancy and directs the search. The second is a more “independent” support strategy, in which the system performs a search and evaluates its findings without informing the user before the search is completed. The third is a “conventional” strategy (not an expert system) in which the system only provides information according to the user's request, but it does not make judgments/ decisions; the user himself is expected to evaluate and to decide. Three main questions are examined in the experiments: (a) which of the three support strategies or systems is more effective in suggesting the appropriate query terms; (b) which of the approaches is preferred by users; and (c) which of the expert systems is more efficient, i.e. more “accurate” and “fast” in performing its consultation job. The experiments reveal that the performance of the system with the first two strategies is similar, and it is significantly better than the performance with the third strategy. Similarly, users generally prefer these two strategies over the “conventional” strategy. Between the first two, the more “independent” system behaves more “intelligently” than the more “participative” one. {\textcopyright} 1986, Academic Press Inc. (London) Limited.

abstract = {Almost all animals show sex differences in body size. For example, in Drosophila, females are larger than males. Although Drosophila is widely used as a model to study growth, the mechanisms underlying this male-female difference in size remain unclear. Here, we describe a novel role for the sex determination gene transformer (tra) in promoting female body growth. Normally, Tra is expressed only in females. We find that loss of Tra in female larvae decreases body size, while ectopic Tra expression in males increases body size. Although we find that Tra exerts autonomous effects on cell size, we also discovered that Tra expression in the fat body augments female body size in a non cell-autonomous manner. These effects of Tra do not require its only known targets doublesex and fruitless. Instead, Tra expression in the female fat body promotes growth by stimulating the secretion of insulin-like peptides from insulin producing cells in the brain. Our data suggest a model of sex-specific growth in which body size is regulated by a previously unrecognized branch of the sex determination pathway, and identify Tra as a novel link between sex and the conserved insulin signaling pathway.},

abstract = {The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the anterior hypothalamus is implicated in the temporal organization of circadian rhythms in a variety of physiological, endocrine and behavioral processes. There is a great deal of evidence indicating that aging is characterized by a progressive deterioration of circadian timekeeping. The present study was aimed at investigating whether there are age-related changes in circadian rhythmicity of the vasopressin (VP)-producing neurons in the human SCN. To that end brains obtained at autopsy of 39 subjects, ranging in age from 6 to 91 years, were studied. Subjects were divided into two age groups, viz. 'young subjects' (up to 50 years) and 'elderly subjects' (over 50 years). It is shown that the number of VP-immunoreactive neurons in the human SCN exhibits a marked diurnal oscillation in young, but not in elderly, people. Whereas in young subjects low VP-immunoreactive neuron numbers were found during the night period (22:00-06:00 h) and peak values during the early morning (06:00-10:00 h), the SCN of elderly people showed a reduced amplitude and a tendency for a reversed diurnal pattern with high instead of low values during the night. The findings suggest that the VP synthesis of the human SCN exhibits a circadian rhythm that is disrupted later in life.},

A number of studies for amygdala neural circuits that underlie fear conditioning have elucidated specific cellular and molecular mechanisms of emotional memory. Recent technical advances such as optogenetic approaches have not only confirmed the importance of excitatory circuits in fear conditioning, but have also shed new light for a direct role of inhibitory circuits in both the acquisition and extinction of fear memory in addition to their role in fine tuning of excitatory neural circuitry. As a result, the circuits in amygdala could be drawn more elaborately, and it led us to understand how fear or extinction memories are formed in the detailed circuit level, and various neuromodulators affect these circuit activities, inducing subtle behavioral changes.},

From the current state of knowledge, the impact of free DNA of transgenic origin is likely to be negli- gible compared with the large amount of total free DNA.We can find no compelling scientific arguments to demonstrate that GM crops are innately different from non-GM crops. The kinds of potential impacts of GM crops fall into classes familiar from the cultivation of non-GM crops (e.g., invasiveness, weediness, toxicity, or biodiversity). It is likely, however, that the novelty of some of the products of GM crop improvement will present new challenges and perhaps opportunities to manage particular crops in creative ways. Debates},

abstract = {Background. A receptor for leptin has been cloned from the choroid plexus, the site of cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) production and the location of the blood/cerebrospinal-fluid barrier. Thus, this receptor might serve as a transporter for leptin. We have studied leptin concentrations in serum and (CSF). Methods and findings. We demonstrated by radioimmunoassay and western blot the presence of leptin in human CSF. We then measured leptin in CSF and serum in 31 individuals with a wide range of bodyweight. Mean serum leptin was 318{\%} higher in 8 obese (40.2 [SE 8.6] ng/mL) than in 23 lean individuals (9.6 [1.5] ng/mL, p {\textless} 0.0005). However, the CSF leptin concentration in obese individuals (0.337 [0.04] ng/mL) was only 30{\%} higher than in lean people (0.259 [0.26] ng/mL, p {\textless} 0.1). Consequently, the leptin CSF/serum ratio in lean individuals (0.047 [0.010]) was 4.3-fold higher than that in obese individuals (0.011 [0.002], p {\textless} 0.05). The relation between CSF leptin and serum leptin was best described by a logarithmic function (r = 0.52, p {\textless} 0.01). Interpretation. Our data suggest that leptin enters the brain by a saturable transport system. The capacity of leptin transport is lower in obese individuals, and may provide a mechanism for leptin resistance.},

Single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequence analyses reveal identical intragenic deletions of SCN5A in affected members of two unrelated LQT families. The deleted sequences reside in a region that is important for channel inactivation.

During a critical period in the postnatal development of the visual cortex, the occlusion of one eye triggers a rapid reorganization of neuronal responses, a process known as ocular dominance plasticity. We have shown that the transplantation of inhibitory neurons induces ocular dominance plasticity after the critical period. Transplanted inhibitory neurons receive excitatory synapses, make inhibitory synapses onto host cortical neurons, and promote plasticity when they reach a cellular age equivalent to that of endogenous inhibitory neurons during the normal critical period. These findings suggest that ocular dominance plasticity is regulated by the execution of a maturational program intrinsic to inhibitory neurons. By inducing plasticity, inhibitory neuron transplantation may facilitate brain repair.},

abstract = {For many years people have speculated that electroencephalographic activity or other electrophysiological measures of brain function might provide a new non-muscular channel for sending messages and commands to the external world - a brain-computer interface (BCI). Over the past 15 years, productive BCI research programs have arisen. Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by the advent of powerful low-cost computer equipment, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, these programs concentrate on developing new augmentative communication and control technology for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users, who may be completely paralyzed, or 'locked in', with basic communication capabilities so that they can express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses. Present-day BCIs determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological signals. These signals include slow cortical potentials, P300 potentials, and mu or beta rhythms recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other device. Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the BCI derive the commands from the signals. Thus, the user and the BCI system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance. Current BCIs have maximum information transfer rates up to 10-25bits/min. This limited capacity can be valuable for people whose severe disabilities prevent them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. At the same time, many possible applications of BCI technology, such as neuroprosthesis control, may require higher information transfer rates. Future progress will depend on: recognition that BCI research and development is an interdisciplinary problem, involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science; identification of those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are best able to control independent of activity in conventional motor output pathways; development of training methods for helping users to gain and maintain that control; delineation of the best algorithms for translating these signals into device commands; attention to the identification and elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of precise and objective procedures for evaluating BCI performance; recognition of the need for long-term as well as short-term assessment of BCI performance; identification of appropriate BCI applications and appropriate matching of applications and users; and attention to factors that affect user acceptance of augmentative technology, including ease of use, cosmesis, and provision of those communication and control capacities that are most important to the user. Development of BCI technology will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research publications and avoidance of the hyperbolic and often misleading media attention that tends to generate unrealistic expectations in the public and skepticism in other researchers. With adequate recognition and effective engagement of all these issues, BCI systems could eventually provide an important new communication and control option for those with motor disabilities and might also give those without disabilities a supplementary control channel or a control channel useful in special circumstances.},

abstract = {Short-term plasticity (STP) denotes changes in synaptic strength that last up to tens of seconds. It is generally thought that STP impacts information transfer across synaptic connections and may thereby provide neurons with, for example, the ability to detect input coherence, to maintain stability and to promote synchronization. STP is due to a combination of mechanisms, including vesicle depletion and calcium accumulation in synaptic terminals. Different forms of STP exist, depending on many factors, including synapse type. Recent evidence shows that synapse dependence holds true even for connections that originate from a single presynaptic cell, which implies that postsynaptic target cell type can determine synaptic short-term dynamics. This arrangement is surprising, since STP itself is chiefly due to presynaptic mechanisms. Target-specific synaptic dynamics in addition imply that STP is not a bug resulting from synapses fatiguing when driven too hard, but rather a feature that is selectively implemented in the brain for specific functional purposes. As an example, target-specific STP results in sequential somatic and dendritic inhibition in neocortical and hippocampal excitatory cells during high-frequency firing. Recent studies also show that the Elfn1 gene specifically controls STP at some synapse types. In addition, presynaptic NMDA receptors have been implicated in synapse-specific control of synaptic dynamics during high-frequency activity. We argue that synapse-specific STP deserves considerable further study, both experimentally and theoretically, since its function is not well known. We propose that synapse-specific STP has to be understood in the context of the local circuit, which requires combining different scientific disciplines ranging from molecular biology through electrophysiology to computer modeling.},

abstract = {Theta-burst Stimulation (TBS) is a novel form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Applied over the primary motor cortex it has been successfully used to induce changes in cortical excitability. The advantage of this stimulation paradigm is that it is able to induce strong and long lasting effects using a lower stimulation intensity and a shorter time of stimulation compared to conventional rTMS protocols. Since its first description, TBS has been used in both basic and clinical research in the last years and more recently it has been expanded to other domains than the motor system. Its capacity to induce synaptic plasticity could lead to therapeutic implications for neuropsychiatric disorders. The neurobiological mechanisms of TBS are not fully understood at present; they may involve long-term potentiation (LTP)- and depression (LTD)-like processes, as well as inhibitory mechanisms modulated by GABAergic activity. This article highlights current hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of action of TBS and some central factors which may influence cortical responses to TBS. Furthermore, previous and ongoing research performed in the field of TBS on the motor cortex is summarized.},

abstract = {This study was undertaken to investigate the changes in obesity (OB) gene expression and production of leptin in response to insulin in vitro and in vivo under euglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions in humans. Three protocols were used: 1) euglycemic clamp with insulin infusion rates at 40, 120, 300, and 1,200 mU / m / min carried out for up to 5 h performed in 16 normal lean individuals, 30 obese individuals, and 31 patients with NIDDM; 2) 64-to 72-h hyperglycemic (glucose 12.6 mmol/l) clamp performed on 5 lean individuals; 3) long-term (96-h) primary culture of isolated abdominal adipocytes in the presence and absence of 100 nmol/l insulin. Short-term hyperinsulinemia in the range of 80 to {\textgreater} 10,000 microU/ml had no effect on circulating levels of leptin. During the prolonged hyperglycemic clamp, a rise in leptin was observed during the last 24 h of the study (P {\textless} 0.001). In the presence of insulin in vitro, OB gene expression increased at 72 h (P {\textless} 0.01), followed by an increase in leptin released to the medium (P {\textless} 0.001). In summary, insulin does not stimulate leptin production acutely; however, a long-term effect of insulin on leptin production could be demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. These data suggest that insulin regulates OB gene expression and leptin production indirectly, probably through its trophic effect on adipocytes.},

abstract = {In the mammalian retina, multiple mechanisms are responsible for guiding retinal ganglion cell axons to the optic fissure. In the present study we have used time-lapse videomicroscopy to show that, within the center of the retinal neuroepithelium, growth cones use a scaffold of previously formed axons as a substrate for guidance. High magnification time-lapse videomicroscopy of normal growth cones in the midretina have shown that they have the ability to alter their shape from long, streamlined forms that hug other axons to more flattened forms that move between axons or neuroepithelial endfeet. In studies on the role of specific cell interactions in these events, Fab fragments against L1 and NCAM, administered either alone or in combination, were found to have dramatic and distinct effects on retinal ganglion cell growth cones. Anti-L1 Fab fragments severely disrupted radial growth cone orientation and rate of outgrowth. The anti-L1-treated growth cones initially stalled for 2 h, then changed direction and, thereafter, resumed an elongation rate twice as fast as in control preparations. By contrast, anti-NCAM Fab did not affect growth cone direction, but caused subsets of growth cones to speed up initially, then to dramatically increase in size, stall, and eventually halt. These results imply that L1 and NCAM play different roles in the promotion and direction of axon growth and, along with repulsive molecules and physical channels, provide essential information for the unidirectional growth of retinal axons into the optic fissure.},

abstract = {Small, genetically tractable species such as larval zebrafish, Drosophila or C. elegans have become key model organisms in modern neuroscience. In addition to their low maintenance costs and easy sharing of strains across labs, one key appeal is the possibility to monitor single or groups of animals in a behavioural arena while controlling the activity of select neurons using optogenetic or thermogenetic tools. However, the purchase of a commercial solution for these types of experiments, including an appropriate camera system as well as a controlled behavioural arena can be costly. Here, we present a low-cost and modular open-source alternative called FlyPi. Our design is based on a 3-D printed mainframe, a Raspberry Pi computer and high-definition camera system as well as Arduino-based optical and thermal control circuits. Depending on the configuration, FlyPi can be assembled for well under 100 Euros and features optional modules for LED-based fluorescence microscopy and optogenetic stimulation as well as a Peltier-based temperature stimulator for thermogenetics. The complete version with all modules costs {\~{}}200 Euros, or substantially less if the user is prepared to shop around. All functions of FlyPi can be controlled through a custom-written graphical user interface. To demonstrate FlyPis capabilities we present its use in a series of state-of-the-art neurogenetics experiments. In addition, we demonstrate FlyPis utility as a medical diagnostic tool as well as a teaching aid at Neurogenetics courses held at several African universities. Taken together, the low cost and modular nature as well as fully open design of FlyPi make it a highly versatile tool in a range of applications, including the classroom, diagnostic centres and research labs.},

abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of animal navigation requires quantitative assessment of the sensorimotor strategies used during navigation and quantitative assessment of how these strategies are regulated by cellular sensors. Here, we examine thermotactic behavior of the Drosophila melanogaster larva using a tracking microscope to study individual larval movements on defined temperature gradients. We discover that larval thermotaxis involves a larger repertoire of strategies than navigation in smaller organisms such as motile bacteria and Caenorhabditis elegans. Beyond regulating run length (i.e., biasing a random walk), the Drosophila melanogaster larva also regulates the size and direction of turns to achieve and maintain favorable orientations. Thus, the sharp turns in a larva's trajectory represent decision points for selecting new directions of forward movement. The larva uses the same strategies to move up temperature gradients during positive thermotaxis and to move down temperature gradients during negative thermotaxis. Disrupting positive thermotaxis by inactivating cold-sensitive neurons in the larva's terminal organ weakens all regulation of turning decisions, suggesting that information from one set of temperature sensors is used to regulate all aspects of turning decisions. The Drosophila melanogaster larva performs thermotaxis by biasing stochastic turning decisions on the basis of temporal variations in thermosensory input, thereby augmenting the likelihood of heading toward favorable temperatures at all times.},

We have examined the initial steps required for the induction of long-term depression (LTD) in CA1 pyramidal cells by repetitive low frequency (1 Hz) synaptic stimulation. This form of LTD was synapse specific, was saturable, and required activation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors. Loading CA1 cells with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA prevented LTD, whereas lowering extracellular Ca2+ resulted in the induction of LTD by stimulation that previously elicited long-term potentiation. Following LTD, synaptic strength could be increased to its original maximal level, indicating that LTD is reversible and not due to deterioration of individual synapses. Induction of homosynaptic LTD therefore requires an NMDA receptor-dependent change in postsynaptic Ca2+ which may be distinct from that required for long-term potentiation.},

We found that FMRP binds to Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) RNA, a molecule that is involved in neural development and has been implicated in Down syndrome. Elevated Dscam protein levels in FMRP null Drosophila and in flies with three copies of the Dscam gene both produced specific and similar synaptic targeting errors in a hard-wired neural circuit, which impaired the flies' sensory perception. Reducing Dscam levels in FMRP null flies reduced synaptic targeting errors and rescued behavioral responses. Our results indicate that excess Dscam protein may be a common molecular mechanism underlying altered neural wiring in intellectual disabilities such as Fragile X and Down syndromes.},

abstract = {In approximately one billion people, a point mutation inactivates a key detoxifying enzyme, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2). This mitochondrial enzyme metabolizes toxic biogenic and environmental aldehydes, including the endogenously produced 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) and the environmental pollutant acrolein, and also bioactivates nitroglycerin. ALDH2 is best known, however, for its role in ethanol metabolism. The accumulation of acetaldehyde following the consumption of even a single alcoholic beverage leads to the Asian alcohol-induced flushing syndrome in ALDH2*2 homozygotes. The ALDH2*2 allele is semidominant, and heterozygotic individuals show a similar but less severe phenotype. We recently identified a small molecule, Alda-1, that activates wild-type ALDH2 and restores near-wild-type activity to ALDH2*2. The structures of Alda-1 bound to ALDH2 and ALDH2*2 reveal how Alda-1 activates the wild-type enzyme and how it restores the activity of ALDH2*2 by acting as a structural chaperone.},

Notable advances include novel insights into the sensory control of social interactions and the identification of molecularly-specified neuronal populations in the brain that control mating, aggression, and parental behaviors. In the case of the latter, these advances mark a watershed because scientists can now focus on discrete neural pathways in an effort to understand how the brain encodes these fundamental social behaviors.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-2 (4E-BP2) is a repressor of cap-dependent mRNA translation and a major downstream effector of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) implicated in hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity and memory. Yet, synaptic mechanisms regulated by 4E-BP2 translational repression remain unknown. Combining knock-out mice, whole-cell recordings, spine analysis, and translation profiling, we found that 4E-BP2 deletion selectively upregulated synthesis of glutamate receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2, facilitating AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic transmission and affecting translation-dependent chemically induced late long-term potentiation (cL-LTP). In 4E-BP2 knock-out (4E-BP2(-/-)) mice, evoked and miniature EPSCs were increased, an effect mimicked by short-hairpin RNA knockdown of 4E-BP2 in wild-type mice, indicating that 4E-BP2 level regulates basal transmission at mature hippocampal AMPAR-containing synapses. Remarkably, in 4E-BP2(-/-) mice, the AMPA to NMDA receptor (NMDAR) EPSC ratio was increased, without affecting NMDAR-mediated EPSCs. The enhanced AMPAR function concurred with increased spine density and decreased length resulting from greater proportion of regular spines and less filopodia in 4E-BP2(-/-) mice. Polysome profiling revealed that translation of GluA1 and GluA2 subunits, but not GluN1 or GluN2A/B, was selectively increased in 4E-BP2(-/-) hippocampi, consistent with unaltered I-V relation of EPSCs mediated by GluA1/GluA2 heteromers. Finally, translation-dependent cL-LTP of unitary EPSCs was also affected in 4E-BP2(-/-) mice, lowering induction threshold and removing mTOR signaling requirement while impairing induction by normal stimulation. Thus, translational control through 4E-BP2 represents a unique mechanism for selective regulation of AMPAR synthesis, synaptic function, and long-term plasticity, important for hippocampal-dependent memory processes.},

abstract = {Chemotaxis is a powerful paradigm to study how orientation behavior is driven by sensory stimulation. Drosophila larvae navigate odor gradients by controlling the duration of their runs and the direction of their turns. Straight runs and wide-amplitude turns represent two extremes of a behavioral continuum. Here we establish that, on average, runs curl toward the direction of higher odor concentrations. We find that the orientation and strength of the local odor gradient perpendicular to the direction of motion modulates the orientation of individual runs in a gradual manner. We discuss how this error-correction mechanism, called weathervaning, contributes to larval chemotaxis. We use larvae with genetically modified olfactory systems to demonstrate that unilateral function restricted to a single olfactory sensory neuron is sufficient to direct weathervaning. Our finding that bilateral sensing is not necessary to control weathervaning highlights the role of temporal sampling. A correlative analysis between sensory inputs and behavioral outputs suggest that weathervaning results from low-amplitude head casts implemented without interruption of the run. In addition, we report the involvement of a sensorimotor memory arising from previous reorientation events. Together, our results indicate that larval chemotaxis combines concurrent orientation strategies that involve complex computations on different timescales.},

abstract = {There has been much debate concerning whether cis-regulatory or coding changes are more likely to produce evolutionary innovation or adaptation in gene function, but an additional complication is that some genes can dramatically diverge through alternative splicing, increasing the diversity of gene function within a locus. The fruitless gene is a major transcription factor with a wide range of pleiotropic functions, including a fundamental conserved role in sexual differentiation, species-specific morphology and an important influence on male sexual behaviour. Here, we examine the structure of fruitless in multiple species of Drosophila, and determine the patterns of selective constraint acting across the coding region. We found that the pattern of selection, estimated from the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, varied considerably across the gene, with most regions of the gene evolutionarily conserved but with several regions showing evidence of divergence as a result of positive selection. The regions that showed evidence of positive selection were found to be localised to relatively consistent regions across multiple speciation events, and are associated with alternative splicing. Alternative splicing may thus provide a route to gene diversification in key regulatory loci.},

Neural systems employ several strategies to facilitate sensory discrimination: Biophysical mechanisms separate the neuronal response distributions in coding space, compress their variances, and combine information from sequential observations. We review how these strategies are implemented in the olfactory system of the fruit fly. The emerging principles of odor discrimination likely apply to other neural circuits of similar architecture.},

Within the CNS, viral tracing techniques that rely on retrograde transsynaptic transfer provide a powerful tool for delineating circuit organization. Viral tracing of the circuits engaged by primary sensory neurons has, however, been hampered by the absence of a genetically tractable anterograde transfer system. In this study, we demonstrate that rabies virus can infect sensory neurons in the somatosensory system, is subject to anterograde transsynaptic transfer from primary sensory to spinal target neurons, and can delineate output connectivity with third-order neurons. Anterograde transsynaptic transfer is a feature shared by other classes of primary sensory neurons, permitting the identification and potentially the manipulation of neural circuits processing sensory feedback within the mammalian CNS. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Our goal is to simultaneously identify the locations of the neurons, demix spatially overlapping components, and denoise and deconvolve the spiking activity from the slow dynamics of the calcium indicator. Our approach relies on a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization that expresses the spatiotemporal fluorescence activity as the product of a spatial matrix that encodes the spatial footprint of each neuron in the optical field and a temporal matrix that characterizes the calcium concentration of each neuron over time. This framework is combined with a novel constrained deconvolution approach that extracts estimates of neural activity from fluorescence traces, to create a spatiotemporal processing algorithm that requires minimal parameter tuning. We demonstrate the general applicability of our method by applying it to in vitro and in vivo multi-neuronal imaging data, whole-brain light-sheet imaging data, and dendritic imaging data. Advances in calcium imaging pose significant statistical analysis challenges. Pnevmatikakis et al. present a method for identifying and spatially demixing imaged neural components and deconvolving their activity from the indicator dynamics.

These sexually dimorphic neurons (s-Abg) project toward regions of the abdomen involved in male reproduction. The s-Abg neurons and the proximal extents of their axons were unstained or absent in wild-type females and exhibited subnormal or no 5-HT immunoreactivity in certain fru-mutant males, indicating that fruitless controls the formation of these cells or 5-HT production in them.},

The postnatal maturation of intracortical inhibitory circuitry and the development of responses to applied gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and baclofen were studied in pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons from layers II and III of the rat primary somatosensory and primary visual cortex, in vitro. 2. Depolarizing spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) could be recorded in approximately 70{\%} of the young (postnatal day 4-10; P4-10), juvenile (P11-16), and adult cells (P28-41), respectively, when they were loaded with nitrate. At all ages these spontaneous events could be blocked by application of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI), indicating that they were mediated by activation of GABAA receptors. 3. In 122 of the 130 adult cells tested, standardized electrical stimulation of the white matter or layer VI evoked a brief excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), followed by both a fast (f-) and a long-latency (l-)IPSP. Similar stimuli evoked a biphasic IPSP in only 51 of the 98 juvenile and in only 1 of the 56 young neurons studied. The mean peak conductance of the f-IPSP and the l-IPSP increased significantly from 50.2 and 7.5 nS, respectively, in juvenile cells to 84.2 and 18.0 nS, respectively, in adult neurons. 4. Application of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist D-amino-phosphonovaleric acid (D-APV) to juvenile cells induced a significant negative shift in the reversal potential of both the f-IPSP and l-IPSP. This effect was accompanied by a reduction in the peak conductance during these events by 31 and 48{\%}, respectively, indicating that a prominent long-lasting NMDA receptor-mediated EPSP occurs concurrent with the early and late IPSP in immature neurons. In adult neurons, D-APV had no significant effect on the reversal potential of the f- and l-IPSP, although the peak conductance decreased by 20 and 5{\%}, respectively, suggesting that there was a smaller concurrent activation of NMDA receptors in this age group. 5. The functional maturation of GABAA and GABAB receptors was studied using focal applications of GABA to the soma and the apical dendrite. Somatic GABA applications to adult neurons held at depolarized membrane potentials evoked a triphasic response, consisting of 1) a GABAA-mediated hyperpolarizing fast component (GABAhf; reversal potential, -76 mV), 2) a GABAA-mediated depolarizing phase (GABAd; -54 mV), and 3) a hyperpolarizing late response (GABAhl; -80 mV). The GABAd response could be demonstrated at all ages in almost every neuron.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoid hormones are secreted in response to stimuli that activate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and self-regulate through negative feedback. Negative feedback that occurs on a rapid time scale is thought to act through nongenomic mechanisms. In these studies, we investigated fast feedback inhibition of HPA axis stress responses by direct glucocorticoid action at the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). Local infusion of dexamethasone or a membrane-impermeant dexamethasone-BSA conjugate into the PVN rapidly inhibits restraint-induced ACTH and corticosterone release in a manner consistent with feedback actions at the cell membrane. The dexamethasone fast feedback response is blocked by the cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist AM-251, suggesting that fast feedback requires local release of endocannabinoids. Hypothalamic tissue content of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol is elevated by restraint stress, consistent with endocannabinoid action on feedback processes. These data support the hypothesis that glucocorticoid-induced fast feedback inhibition of the HPA axis is mediated by a nongenomic signaling mechanism that involves endocannabinoid signaling at the level of the PVN.},

abstract = {Background: Many organisms, from bacteria to human hunter-gatherers, use specialized random walk strategies to explore their environment. Such behaviors are an efficient stratagem for sampling the environment and usually consist of an alternation between straight runs and turns that redirect these runs. Drosophila larvae execute an exploratory routine of this kind that consists of sequences of straight crawls, pauses, turns, and redirected crawls. Central pattern generating networks underlying rhythmic movements are distributed along the anteroposterior axis of the nervous system. The way in which the operation of these networks is incorporated into extended behavioral routines such as substrate exploration has not yet been explored. In particular, the part played by the brain in dictating the sequence of movements required is unknown. Results: We report the use of a genetic method to block synaptic activity acutely in the brain and subesophageal ganglia (SOG) of larvae during active exploratory behavior. We show that the brain and SOG are not required for the normal performance of an exploratory routine. Alternation between crawls and turns is an intrinsic property of the abdominal and/or thoracic networks. The brain modifies this autonomous routine during goal-directed movements such as those of chemotaxis. Nonetheless, light avoidance behavior can be mediated in the absence of brain activity solely by the sensorimotor system of the abdomen and thorax. Conclusions: The sequence of movements for substrate exploration is an autonomous capacity of the thoracic and abdominal nervous system. The brain modulates this exploratory routine in response to environmental cues. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this review, we use two recent, high-resolution structures as foundations for examining our current understanding of the fundamental functions that are shared by all K(+) channels, such as K(+) selectivity and channel gating, as well as characteristic features of Kir channel family members, such as inward rectification and their regulation by intracellular factors.},

abstract = {To understand the organization and assembly of mammalian brain circuits, we need a comprehensive tool set that can address the challenges of cellular diversity, spatial complexity at synapse resolution, dynamic complexity of circuit operations, and multifaceted developmental processes rooted in the genome. Complementary to physics- and chemistry-based methods, genetic tools tap into intrinsic cellular and developmental mechanisms. Thus, they have the potential to achieve appropriate spatiotemporal resolution and the cellular-molecular specificity necessary for observing and probing the makings and inner workings of neurons and neuronal circuits. Furthermore, genetic analysis will be key to unraveling the intricate link from genes to circuits to systems, in part through systematic targeting and tracking of individual cellular components of neural circuits. Here we review recent progress in genetic tool development and advances in genetic analysis of neural circuits in the mouse. We also discuss future directions and implications for understanding brain disorders.},

abstract = {Using the photopigment melanopsin, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) respond directly to light to drive circadian clock resetting and pupillary constriction. We now report that ipRGCs are more abundant and diverse than previously appreciated, project more widely within the brain, and can support spatial visual perception. A Cre-based melanopsin reporter mouse line revealed at least five subtypes of ipRGCs with distinct morphological and physiological characteristics. Collectively, these cells project beyond the known brain targets of ipRGCs to heavily innervate the superior colliculus and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, retinotopically organized nuclei mediating object localization and discrimination. Mice lacking classical rod-cone photoreception, and thus entirely dependent on melanopsin for light detection, were able to discriminate grating stimuli from equiluminant gray and had measurable visual acuity. Thus, nonclassical retinal photoreception occurs within diverse cell types and influences circuits and functions encompassing luminance as well as spatial information. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Images of near-membrane Ca(2+) signals were obtained from {\textgreater}100 N-type channels expressed within restricted areas (80 x 80 micro m) of Xenopus oocytes, thereby permitting simultaneous resolution of their gating kinetics, voltage dependence, and localization. Moreover, this technique provided information inaccessible by electrophysiological means, demonstrating that N-type channels are immobile in the membrane, show a patchy distribution, and display diverse gating kinetics even among closely adjacent channels. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy holds great promise for single-channel recording of diverse voltage- and ligand-gated Ca(2+)-permeable channels in the membrane of neurons and other isolated or cultured cells, and has potential for high-throughput functional analysis of single channels.},

A hallmark feature of SCN neuronal populations is that they are mostly electrically silent during the night, start to fire action potentials near dawn and then continue to generate action potentials with a slow and steady pace all day long. Sets of currents are responsible for this daily rhythm, with the strongest evidence for persistent Na(+) currents, L-type Ca(2+) currents, hyperpolarization-activated currents (I(H)), large-conductance Ca(2+) activated K(+) (BK) currents and fast delayed rectifier (FDR) K(+) currents. These rhythms in electrical activity are crucial for the function of the circadian timing system, including the expression of clock genes, and decline with ageing and disease. This article reviews our current understanding of the ionic and molecular mechanisms that drive the rhythmic firing patterns in the SCN.},

Most young mice acquired the spatial task, whereas only a minority of aged mice did. Aged mice not only made significantly more errors but also exhibited greater individual differences. Slices from the hippocampus of aged mice exhibited significantly reduced L-LTP, and this was significantly and negatively correlated with errors in memory. Because L-LTP depends on cAMP activation, we examined whether drugs that enhanced cAMP would attenuate the L-LTP and memory defects. Both dopamine D1/D5 receptor agonists, which are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase, and a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor ameliorated the physiological as well as the memory defects, consistent with the idea that a cAMP-protein kinase A-dependent signaling pathway is defective in age-related spatial memory loss.},

We measured in vivo occupancy of striatal D(2) receptors by dopamine in 18 untreated patients with schizophrenia and 18 matched controls, by comparing D(2) receptor availability before and during pharmacologically induced acute dopamine depletion. Acute depletion of intrasynaptic dopamine resulted in a larger increase in D(2) receptor availability in patients with schizophrenia (19{\%} +/- 11{\%}) compared with control subjects (9{\%} +/- 7{\%}, P = 0.003). The increased occupancy of D(2) receptors by dopamine occurred both in first-episode neuroleptic-naive patients and in previously treated chronic patients experiencing an episode of illness exacerbation. In addition, elevated synaptic dopamine was predictive of good treatment response of positive symptoms to antipsychotic drugs. This finding provides direct evidence of increased stimulation of D(2) receptors by dopamine in schizophrenia, consistent with increased phasic activity of dopaminergic neurons.},

abstract = {Relatively little is known about the genes and brain structures that enable virgin female Drosophila to make the decision to mate or not. Classical genetic approaches have identified several mutant females that have a reluctance-to-mate phenotype, but most of these have additional behavioral defects. However, the icebox (ibx) mutation was previously reported to lower the sexual receptivity of females, without apparently affecting any other aspect of female behavior. We have shown that the ibx mutation maps to the 7F region of the Drosophila X chromosome to form a complex complementation group with both lethal and viable alleles of neuroglian (nrg). The L1-type cell adhesion molecule encoded by nrg consists of six immunoglobulin-like domains, five fibronectin-like domains, one transmembrane domain and one alternatively spliced intracellular domain. The ibx strain has a missense mutation causing a glycine-to-arginine change at amino acid 92 in the first immunoglobulin domain of nrg. Defects in the central brain of ibx mutants are similar to those observed in another nrg mutant, central brain deranged(1) (ceb(1)). However, both ceb(1) homozygous and ceb(1)/ibx heterozygous females are receptive. The expression of a transgene containing the non-neural isoform of nrg rescues both the receptivity and the brain structure phenotypes of ibx females.},

abstract = {Neural circuits for behavior transform sensory inputs into motor outputs in patterns with strategic value. Determining how neurons along a sensorimotor circuit contribute to this transformation is central to understanding behavior. To do this, a quantitative framework to describe behavioral dynamics is needed. In this study, we built a high-throughput optogenetic system for Drosophila larva to quantify the sensorimotor transformations underlying navigational behavior. We express CsChrimson, a red-shifted variant of channelrhodopsin, in specific chemosensory neurons and expose large numbers of freely moving animals to random optogenetic activation patterns. We quantify their behavioral responses and use reverse-correlation analysis to uncover the linear and static nonlinear components of navigation dynamics as functions of optogenetic activation patterns of specific sensory neurons. We find that linear-nonlinear models accurately predict navigational decision-making for different optogenetic activation waveforms. We use our method to establish the valence and dynamics of navigation driven by optogenetic activation of different combinations of bitter-sensing gustatory neurons. Our method captures the dynamics of optogenetically induced behavior in compact, quantitative transformations that can be used to characterize circuits for sensorimotor processing and their contribution to navigational decision making.},

Even within disease infection labels, patients can exhibit significant variability; "fever" may mean something different when reported in a doctor's office versus from an online app, precluding directly learning across different datasets for the same prediction task. This problem falls into the domain adaptation paradigm. However, research in this area has to-date not considered who generates the data; symptoms reported by a woman versus a man, for example, could also have different implications. We propose a novel population-aware domain adaptation approach by formulating the domain adaptation task as a multi-source hierarchical Bayesian framework. The model improves prediction in the case of largely unlabelled target data by harnessing both domain and population invariant information.},

abstract = {The mushroom body (MB) is an important centre for higher order sensory integration and learning in insects. To analyse the development and organisation of the MB neuropile in Drosophila, we performed cell lineage analysis in the adult brain with a new technique that combines the Flippase (flp)/FRT system and the GAL4/UAS system. We showed that the four mushroom body neuroblasts (MBNbs) give birth exclusively to the neurones and glial cells of the MB, and that each of the four MBNb clones contributes to the entire MB structure. The expression patterns of 19 GAL4 enhancer-trap strains that mark various subsets of MB cells revealed overlapping cell types in all four of the MBNb lineages. Partial ablation of MBNbs using hydroxyurea showed that each of the four neuroblasts autonomously generates the entire repertoire of the known MB substructures.},

This gene is expressed in a circadian pattern in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). mper1 maintains this pattern of circadian expression in constant darkness and can be entrained to a new light/dark cycle. Here we report the isolation of a second mammalian gene, mper2, which also has these properties and greater homology to Drosophila period. Expression of mper1 and mper2 is overlapping but asynchronous by 4 hr. mper1, unlike period and mper2, is expressed rapidly after exposure to light at CT22. It appears that mper1 is the pacemaker component which responds to light and thus mediates photic entrainment.},

Individual DNs have been well-studied in species from insects to primates, but little is known about overall connectivity patterns across the DN population. We systematically investigated DN anatomy in Drosophila melanogaster and created over 100 transgenic lines targeting individual cell types. We identified roughly half of all Drosophila DNs and comprehensively map connectivity between sensory and motor neuropils in the brain and nerve cord, respectively. We find the nerve cord is a layered system of neuropils reflecting the fly's capability for two largely independent means of locomotion -- walking and flight -- using distinct sets of appendages. Our results reveal the basic functional map of descending pathways in flies and provide tools for systematic interrogation of neural circuits.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A number of forms of neuronal plasticity are thought to be mediated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Here, we investigate the role of CaMKII in CEDE. We find that the developmental time course of CEDE parallels the expression of alphaCaMKII, a dominant subunit of CaMKII. An inhibitor of this enzyme, KN-62, blocks CEDE. Furthermore, 7 d in vitro neurons (which normally do not express alphaCaMKII nor show CEDE) can undergo CEDE when infected with a recombinant virus producing alphaCaMKII. Expression of a constitutively active CaMKII produces dendritic exocytosis in the absence of calcium stimulus, and this exocytosis is blocked by nocodazole, an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization that also blocks CEDE. These results indicate that CEDE is mediated by the activation of CaMKII, consistent with the view that CEDE plays a role in synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {Reliable activation of inhibitory pathways is essential for maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition during cortical activity. Little is known, however, about the activation of these pathways at the level of the local neocortical microcircuit. We report a disynaptic inhibitory pathway among neocortical pyramidal cells (PCs). Inhibitory responses were evoked in layer 5 PCs following stimulation of individual neighboring PCs with trains of action potentials. The probability for inhibition between PCs was more than twice that of direct excitation, and inhibitory responses increased as a function of rate and duration of presynaptic discharge. Simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings indicated that inhibition originated from PC apical and tuft dendrites. Multineuron whole-cell recordings from PCs and interneurons combined with morphological reconstructions revealed the mediating interneurons as Martinotti cells. Martinotti cells received facilitating synapses from PCs and formed reliable inhibitory synapses onto dendrites of neighboring PCs. We describe this feedback pathway and propose it as a central mechanism for regulation of cortical activity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here, we review recent developments in the field of STSP, discussing both long-term and short-term variants and with particular emphasis on neocortical function. As there are dozens of neocortical cell types, there is a multiplicity of forms of STSP, the vast majority of which have never been explored.

abstract = {The mushroom bodies (MBs) are prominent structures in the Drosophila brain that are essential for olfactory learning and memory. Characterization of the development and projection patterns of individual MB neurons will be important for elucidating their functions. Using mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (Lee, T. and Luo, L. (1999) Neuron 22, 451-461), we have positively marked the axons and dendrites of multicellular and single-cell mushroom body clones at specific developmental stages. Systematic clonal analysis demonstrates that a single mushroom body neuroblast sequentially generates at least three types of morphologically distinct neurons. Neurons projecting into the (gamma) lobe of the adult MB are born first, prior to the mid-3rd instar larval stage. Neurons projecting into the alpha' and beta' lobes are born between the mid-3rd instar larval stage and puparium formation. Finally, neurons projecting into the alpha and beta lobes are born after puparium formation. Visualization of individual MB neurons has also revealed how different neurons acquire their characteristic axon projections. During the larval stage, axons of all MB neurons bifurcate into both the dorsal and medial lobes. Shortly after puparium formation, larval MB neurons are selectively pruned according to birthdays. Degeneration of axon branches makes early-born gamma neurons retain only their main processes in the peduncle, which then project into the adult gamma lobe without bifurcation. In contrast, the basic axon projections of the later-born (alpha'/beta') larval neurons are preserved during metamorphosis. This study illustrates the cellular organization of mushroom bodies and the development of different MB neurons at the single cell level. It allows for future studies on the molecular mechanisms of mushroom body development.},

abstract = {The transmission of pain involves several types of pri-mary unmyelinated Ad-and unmyelinated C afferents from neurons in in the dorsal root (or trigeminal) gan-glion; these afferents activate second-order spinothala-mic and spinobulbar projection neurons in the dorsal horn (or trigeminal nucleus caudalis). The dorsal horn is not a simple relay station but rather a site of complex processing and gating of nociceptive information via circuits involving different subtypes of excitatory or inhibitory interneurons. These neurons are the target of descending pain-modulatory influences from the ros-tral ventromedial medulla and other regions. Pain cir-cuits also participate in the relay and processing of the sensation of itch. Specific molecular markers, such as transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and Mas-related G-protein–coupled receptor (Mrgpr) subtypes, have allowed the identification of different subtypes of primary afferents transmitting pain and itch sensations. The application of transgenic and ablation techniques has provided insight into the heterogeneity of excitatory or inhibitory interneurons and their involvement in dor-sal horn circuits regulating transmission and gating of pain and itch. Excitatory interneurons have a major role in both normal and abnormal transmission of sensory input to the projection neurons; inhibitory interneurons are critically involved in gating these inputs. These find-ings provide new insights into the pathophysiology of the manifestations of neuropathic pain, including spon-taneous pain, hyperalgesia, and mechanical allodynia, as well as neuropathic itch. There are several reviews on all these topics. 1–19 This review is focused on the spinal dorsal horn, although similar processes likely underlie facial trigeminal-mediated pain. BASIC COMPONENTS OF THE DORSAL HORN CIRCUITRY The dorsal horn of the spinal cord is classi-cally subdivided into 5 cytoarchitectonic laminae accord-ing to Rexed 20 (figure 1). Laminae I and II constitute the superficial dorsal horn. Lamina I primarily contains different subtypes of projection (spinothalamic and spi-nobulbar) neurons. Lamina II or substantia gelatinosa is subdivided into an outer and an inner region, both containing different subtypes of local excitatory or inhib-itory interneurons. Laminae III to V constitute the deep dorsal horn and contain different subtypes of projection neurons as well as interneurons. Both the projection neurons and local interneurons receive lamina-specific input from different subtypes of primary afferents from dorsal root ganglion neurons.},

The present study used the Drosophila melanogaster model system and a candidate gene approach to identify novel components required for modulation of an injury-induced nociceptive sensitization pathway presumably downstream of Hedgehog. This study demonstrates that RNAi silencing of a member of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway, Decapentaplegic (Dpp), specifically in the Class IV multidendritic nociceptive neuron, significantly attenuated ultraviolet injury-induced sensitization. Furthermore, overexpres- sion of Dpp in Class IV neurons was sufficient to induce thermal hypersensitivity in the absence of injury. The requirement of various BMPreceptorsandmembersof theSMADsignal transduction pathway in nociceptive sensitizationwasalso demonstrated.Theeffects of BMP signaling were shown to be largely specific to the sensitization pathway and not associated with changes in nociception in the absence of injury or with changes in dendritic morphology. Thus, the results demonstrate that Dpp and its pathway play a crucial and novel role in nociceptive sensitization. Because theBMPfamily is so strongly conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates, it seems likely that the components analyzed in this study represent potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of chronic pain in humans.},

abstract = {The voltage sensor of the Shaker potassium channel is comprised mostly of positively charged residues in the putative fourth transmembrane segment, S4 (Aggarwal, S.K., and R.

Movement of the voltage sensor in response to a change in the membrane potential was examined indirectly by measuring how the accessibilities of residues in and around the sensor change with voltage. Each basic residue in the S4 segment was individually replaced with a histidine. If the histidine tag is part of the voltage sensor, then the gating charge displaced by the voltage sensor will include the histidine charge. Accessibility of the histidine to the bulk solution was therefore monitored as pH-dependent changes in the gating currents evoked by membrane potential pulses. Histidine scanning mutagenesis has several advantages over other similar techniques. Since histidine accessibility is detected by labeling with solution protons, very confined local environments can be resolved and labeling introduces minimal interference of voltage sensor motion. After histidine replacement of either residue K374 or R377, there was no titration of the gating currents with internal or external pH, indicating that these residues do not move in the transmembrane electric field or that they are always inaccessible. Histidine replacement of residues R365, R368, and R371, on the other hand, showed that each of these residues traverses entirely from internal exposure at hyperpolarized potentials to external exposure at depolarized potentials. This translocation enables the histidine to transport protons across the membrane in the presence of a pH gradient. In the case of 371H, depolarization drives the histidine to a position that forms a proton pore. Kinetic models of titrateable voltage sensors that account for proton transport and conduction are presented. Finally, the results presented here are incorporated into existing information to propose a model of voltage sensor movement and structure.},

abstract = {Enormous strides in understanding aging have come from the discovery that mutations in single genes can extend healthy life-span in laboratory model organisms such as the yeast Saccharomyces, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the mouse. IIS [insulin/IGF (insulin-like growth factor)-like signalling] stands out as an important, evolutionarily conserved pathway involved in the determination of lifespan. The pathway has diverse functions in multicellular organisms, and mutations in IIS can affect growth, development, metabolic homoeostasis, fecundity and stress resistance, as well as lifespan. The pleiotropic nature of the pathway and the often negative effects of its disruption mean that the extent, tissue and timing of IIS manipulations are determinants of a positive effect on lifespan. One tissue of particular importance for lifespan extension in diverse organisms is the CNS (central nervous system). Although lowered IIS in the CNS can extend lifespan, IIS is also widely recognized as being neuroprotective and important for growth and survival of neurons. In the present review, we discuss our current understanding of the role of the nervous system in extension of lifespan by altered IIS, and the role of IIS in determination of neuronal function during aging. The nervous system can play both endocrine and cell-autonomous roles in extension of lifespan by IIS, and the effects of IIS on lifespan and neuronal function can be uncoupled to some extent. Tissue-specific manipulation of IIS and the cellular defence mechanisms that it regulates will better define the ways in which IIS affects neuronal and whole-organism function during aging.},

abstract = {In Drosophila, one enzyme (Drosophila tryptophan-phenylalanine hydroxylase, DTPHu) hydroxylates both tryptophan to yield 5-hydroxytryptophan, the first step in serotonin synthesis, and phenylalanine, to generate tyrosine. Analysis of the sequenced Drosophila genome identified an additional enzyme with extensive homology to mammalian tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), which we have termed DTRHn. We have shown that DTRHn can hydroxylate tryptophan in vitro but displays differential activity relative to DTPHu when using tryptophan as a substrate. Recent studies in mice identified the presence of two TPH genes, Tph1 and Tph2, from distinct genetic loci. Tph1 represents the non-neuronal TPH gene, and Tph2 is expressed exclusively in the brain. In this article, we show that DTRHn is neuronal in expression and function and thus represents the Drosophila homologue of Tph2. Using a DTRHn-null mutation, we show that diminished neuronal serotonin affects locomotor, olfactory and feeding behaviors, as well as heart rate. We also show that DTPHu functions in vivo as a phenylalanine hydroxylase in addition to its role as the peripheral TPH in Drosophila, and is critical for non-neuronal developmental events.},

First, transgenic rescue experiments prove that the Sac locus encodes T1R3, a member of the T1R family of candidate taste receptors. Second, using a heterologous expression system, we demonstrate that T1R2 and T1R3 combine to function as a sweet receptor, recognizing sweet-tasting molecules as diverse as sucrose, saccharin, dulcin, and acesulfame-K. Finally, we present a detailed analysis of the patterns of expression of T1Rs and T2Rs, thus providing a view of the representation of sweet and bitter taste at the periphery.},

abstract = {Selective genetic manipulation of neuronal function in vivo requires techniques for targeting gene expression to specific cells. Existing systems accomplish this using the promoters of endogenous genes to drive expression of transgenes directly in cells of interest or, in "binary" systems, to drive expression of a transcription factor or recombinase that subsequently activates the expression of other transgenes. All such techniques are constrained by the limited specificity of the available promoters. We introduce here a combinatorial system in which the DNA-binding (DBD) and transcription-activation (AD) domains of a transcription factor are independently targeted using two different promoters. The domains heterodimerize to become transcriptionally competent and thus drive transgene expression only at the intersection of the expression patterns of the two promoters. We use this system to dissect a neuronal network in Drosophila by selectively targeting expression of the cell death gene reaper to subsets of neurons within the network.},

Recent structural studies on the bacterial KvAP potassium channel have led to a new model of voltage sensing in which S4 lies in the lipid at the channel periphery and moves through the membrane as a unit with a portion of S3. Here we describe accessibility probing and disulfide scanning experiments aimed at determining how well the KvAP model describes the Drosophila Shaker potassium channel. We find that the S1-S3 helices have one end that is externally exposed, S3 does not undergo a transmembrane motion, and S4 lies in close apposition to the pore domain in the resting and activated state.},

Here, we report on a novel circuit for propagation of waves of muscle contraction, using the peristaltic locomotion of Drosophila larvae as a model system. We found an intersegmental chain of synaptically connected neurons, alternating excitatory and inhibitory, necessary for wave propagation and active in phase with the wave. The excitatory neurons (A27h) are premotor and necessary only for forward locomotion, and are modulated by stretch receptors and descending inputs. The inhibitory neurons (GDL) are necessary for both forward and backward locomotion, suggestive of different yet coupled central pattern generators, and its inhibition is necessary for wave propagation. The circuit structure and functional imaging indicated that the commands to contract one segment promote the relaxation of the next segment, revealing a mechanism for wave propagation in peristaltic locomotion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD) is an autosomal dominant painful neuropathy with many, but not all, cases linked to gain-of-function mutations in SCN9A which encodes voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7. Severe pain episodes and skin flushing start in infancy and are induced by perianal probing or bowl movement, and pain progresses to ocular and mandibular areas with age. Carbamazepine has been effective in relieving symptoms, while other drugs including other anti-epileptics are less effective. RESULTS: Sequencing of SCN9A coding exons from an English patient, diagnosed with PEPD, has identified a methionine 1627 to lysine (M1627K) substitution in the linker joining segments S4 and S5 in domain IV. We confirm that M1627K depolarizes the voltage-dependence of fast-inactivation without substantially altering activation or slow-inactivation, and inactivates from the open state with slower kinetics. We show here that M1627K does not alter development of closed-state inactivation, and that M1627K channels recover from fast-inactivation faster than wild type channels, and produce larger currents in response to a slow ramp stimulus. Using current-clamp recordings, we also show that the M1627K mutant channel reduces the threshold for single action potentials in DRG neurons and increases the number of action potentials in response to graded stimuli. CONCLUSION: M1627K mutation was previously identified in a sporadic case of PEPD from France, and we now report it in an English family. We confirm the initial characterization of mutant M1627K effect on fast-inactivation of Nav1.7 and extend the analysis to other gating properties of the channel. We also show that M1627K mutant channels render DRG neurons hyperexcitable. Our new data provide a link between altered channel biophysics and pain in PEPD patients.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

A contact force regulator capable of accurately applying mechanical stimuli to a live Drosophila larva could greatly facilitate mechanobiology research on Drosophila and may eventually lead to novel discoveries in mechanotransduction of neuron circuitry. In this paper, we present a novel contact force scheme implemented in an automated Drosophila larvae micromanipulation system, featuring a switched fuzzy-PD controller and a noise-insensitive extended high gain observer. The switched fuzzy-PD controller inherits the fast convergence from fuzzy controller and overcomes the drawbacks (overshoot and oscillation) of a conventional fuzzy controller. The observer provides precise estimation to compensate for system modeling errors despite force measurement noise, which overcomes the disadvantage of traditional high gain observer. Force control experiments show that, compared to an conventional PID controller, this new controller-observer scheme has significantly enhanced dynamic performance in terms of rising time, overshoot, and oscillation. The developed robotic system and the force control scheme will be applied to mechanical stimulation and fluorescence imaging of Drosophila larvae for identifying new mechanotransduction mechanisms.},

abstract = {The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an important model organism for biomedical research and genetic studies relevant to human biology and disease. Such studies are often based on high-resolution imaging of dynamic biological processes in the worm body tissues, requiring well-immobilized and physiologically active animals in order to avoid movement-related artifacts and to obtain meaningful biological information. However, existing immobilization methods employ the application of either anesthetics or servere physical constraints, by using glue or specific microfluidic on-chip mechanical structures, which in some cases may strongly affect physiological processes of the animals. Here, we immobilize C. elegans nematodes by taking advantage of a biocompatible and temperature-responsive hydrogel-microbead matrix. Our gel-based immobilization technique does not require a specific chip design and enables fast and reversible immobilization, thereby allowing successive imaging of the same single worm or of small worm populations at all development stages for several days. We successfully demonstrated the applicability of this method in challenging worm imaging contexts, in particular by applying it for high-resolution confocal imaging of the mitochondrial morphology in worm body wall muscle cells and for the long-term quantification of number and size of specific protein aggregates in different C. elegans neurodegenerative disease models. Our approach was also suitable for immobilizing other small organisms, such as the larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei. We anticipate that this versatile technique will significantly simplify biological assay-based longitudinal studies and long-term observation of small model organisms.},

abstract = {In nervous system assembly, Eph/ephrin signaling mediates many axon guidance events that shape the formation of precise neuronal connections. However, due to the complexity of interactions between Ephs and ephrins, the molecular logic of their action is still being unraveled. Considerable advances have been made by studying the innervation of the limb by spinal motor neurons, a series of events governed by Eph/ephrin signaling. Here, we discuss the contributions of different Eph/ephrin modes of interaction, downstream signaling and electrical activity, and how these systems may interact both with each other and with other guidance molecules in limb muscle innervation. This simple model system has emerged as a very powerful tool to study this set of molecules, and will continue to be so by virtue of its simplicity, accessibility and the wealth of pioneering cellular studies. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Understanding the genetic architecture of quantitative traits begins with mapping quantitative trait loci to broad genomic regions and ends with the molecular definition of quantitative trait loci alleles. This has been accomplished for some quantitative trait loci in Drosophila. Drosophila quantitative trait loci have sex-, environment- and genotype-specific effects, and are often associated with molecular polymorphisms in non-coding regions of candidate genes. These observations offer valuable lessons to those seeking to understand quantitative traits in other organisms, including humans.},

abstract = {In the past few years, several experimental studies have suggested that empathy occurs in the social lives of rodents. Thus, rodent behavioral models can now be developed to elucidate the mechanistic substrates of empathy at levels that have heretofore been unavailable. For example, the finding that mice from certain inbred strains express behavioral and physiological responses to conspecific distress, while others do not, underscores that the genetic underpinnings of empathy are specifiable and that they could be harnessed to develop new therapies for human psychosocial impairments. However, the advent of rodent models of empathy is met at the outset with a number of theoretical and semantic problems that are similar to those previously confronted by studies of empathy in humans. The distinct underlying components of empathy must be differentiated from one another and from lay usage of the term. The primary goal of this paper is to review a set of seminal studies that are directly relevant to developing a concept of empathy in rodents. We first consider some of the psychological phenomena that have been associated with empathy, and within this context, we consider the component processes, or endophenotypes of rodent empathy. We then review a series of recent experimental studies that demonstrate the capability of rodents to detect and respond to the affective state of their social partners. We focus primarily on experiments that examine how rodents share affective experiences of fear, but we also highlight how similar types of experimental paradigms can be utilized to evaluate the possibility that rodents share positive affective experiences. Taken together, these studies were inspired by Jaak Panksepp's theory that all mammals are capable of felt affective experiences. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We have examined expression of L1 and the polysialic acid-associated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) in mouse embryos during the major period of axon growth in the retinofugal pathway to determine whether they are expressed in patterns that relate to the changes in axon organization in the pathway. Immunostaining for L1 and PSA-NCAM was found on all axons in the retina and the optic stalk. In the chiasm, while L1 immunoreactivity remained high on the axons, PSA-NCAM staining was obviously reduced. At the threshold of the optic tract, L1 immunoreactivity was maintained only in a subpopulation of axons, whereas PSA-NCAM staining was dramatically elevated in axons at the caudal part of the tract. Further investigations of the tract showed that both L1 and PSA-NCAM were preferentially expressed on the dorsal but not ventral optic axons, indicating a regionally specific change of both adhesion molecules on the axons at the chiasm-tract junction. Moreover, intense PSA-NCAM expression was also observed in the tract of postoptic commissure (TPOC), which lies immediately caudal to the optic tract. Immunohistochemical and retrograde tracing studies showed that these PSA-NCAM-positive axons arose from a population of cells rostral to the CD44-positive chiasmatic neurons. These findings indicate that, in addition to the chiasmatic neurons, these PSA-NCAM-positive diencephalic cells also contribute axons to the TPOC. These early generated commissural axons together with the regionally specific pattern of cell adhesion molecule expression on the optic axons may control formation of the partial retinotopic axon order in the optic tract through homophilic or heterophilic interactions that involve PSA-NCAM.},

abstract = {Odor perception allows animals to distinguish odors, recognize the same odor across concentrations, and determine concentration changes. How the activity patterns of primary olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), at the individual and population levels, facilitate distinguishing these functions remains poorly understood. Here, we interrogate the complete ORN population of the Drosophila larva across a broadly sampled panel of odorants at varying concentrations. We find that the activity of each ORN scales with the concentration of any odorant via a fixed dose-response function with a variable sensitivity. Sensitivities across odorants and ORNs follow a power-law distribution. Much of receptor sensitivity to odorants is accounted for by a single geometrical property of molecular structure. Similarity in the shape of temporal response filters across odorants and ORNs extend these relationships to fluctuating environments. These results uncover shared individual- and population-level patterns that together lend structure to support odor perceptions. The combinatorial olfactory code conveys odor stimulus features in an entangled manner. Si et al. uncover structure and statistical properties in ORN responses that allow separated representations of odor features and shine light on the mechanism of molecular recognition by olfactory receptors.},

abstract = {The prediction that "saturation" of LTP/LTE at hippocampal synapses should impair spatial learning was reinvestigated in the light of a more specific consideration of the theory of Hebbian associative networks, which predicts a nonlinear relationship between LTP "saturation" and memory impairment. This nonlinearity may explain the variable results of studies that have addressed the effects of LTP "saturation" on behavior. The extent of LTP "saturation" in fascia dentata produced by the standard chronic LTP stimulation protocol was assessed both electrophysiologically and through the use of an anatomical marker (activation of the immediate-early gene zif268). Both methods point to the conclusion that the standard protocols used to induce LTP do not "saturate" the process at any dorsoventral level, and leave the ventral half of the hippocampus virtually unaffected. LTP-inducing, bilateral perforant path stimulation led to a significant deficit in the reversal of a well-learned spatial response on the Barnes circular platform task as reported previously, yet in the same animals produced no deficit in learning the Morris water task (for which previous results have been conflicting). The behavioral deficit was not a consequence of any after-discharge in the hippocampal EEG. In contrast, administration of maximal electroconvulsive shock led to robust zif268 activation throughout the hippocampus, enhancement of synaptic responses, occlusion of LTP produced by discrete high-frequency stimulation, and spatial learning deficits in the water task. These data provide further support for the involvement of LTP-like synaptic enhancement in spatial learning.},

abstract = {Identified neuron classes in vertebrate cortical [1–4] and subcortical [5–8] areas and invertebrate peripheral [9–11] and central [12–14] brain neuropils encode specific visual features of a panorama. How downstream neurons integrate these features to control vital behaviors, like escape, is unclear [15]. In Drosophila, the timing of a single spike in the giant fiber (GF) descending neuron [16–18] determines whether a fly uses a short or long takeoff when escaping a looming predator [13]. We previously proposed that GF spike timing results from summation of two visual features whose detection is highly conserved across animals [19]: an object's subtended angular size and its angular velocity [5–8, 11, 20, 21]. We attributed velocity encoding to input from lobula columnar type 4 (LC4) visual projection neurons, but the size-encoding source remained unknown. Here, we show that lobula plate/lobula columnar, type 2 (LPLC2) visual projection neurons anatomically specialized to detect looming [22] provide the entire GF size component. We find LPLC2 neurons to be necessary for GF-mediated escape and show that LPLC2 and LC4 synapse directly onto the GF via reconstruction in a fly brain electron microscopy (EM) volume [23]. LPLC2 silencing eliminates the size component of the GF looming response in patch-clamp recordings, leaving only the velocity component. A model summing a linear function of angular velocity (provided by LC4) and a Gaussian function of angular size (provided by LPLC2) replicates GF looming response dynamics and predicts the peak response time. We thus present an identified circuit in which information from looming feature-detecting neurons is combined by a common post-synaptic target to determine behavioral output. Ache et al. show that the Drosophila giant fiber descending neuron integrates synaptic input from LPLC2 and LC4 visual feature-detecting neurons to drive escape from approaching objects, such as an attacking predator. LPLC2 input to the giant fiber encodes the angular size of an approaching object, whereas LC4 input directly encodes looming speed.},

abstract = {The somatic muscle system formed during Drosophila embryogenesis is required for larvae to hatch, feed, and crawl. This system is replaced in the pupa by a new adult muscle set, responsible for activities such as feeding, walking, and flight. Both the larval and adult muscle systems are comprised of distinct muscle fibers to serve these specific motor functions. In this way, the Drosophila musculature is a valuable model for patterning within a single tissue: while all muscle cells share properties such as the contractile apparatus, properties such as size, position, and number of nuclei are unique for a particular muscle. In the embryo, diversification of muscle fibers relies first on signaling cascades that pattern the mesoderm. Subsequently, the combinatorial expression of specific transcription factors leads muscle fibers to adopt particular sizes, shapes, and orientations. Adult muscle precursors (AMPs), set aside during embryonic development, proliferate during the larval phases and seed the formation of the abdominal, leg, and flight muscles in the adult fly. Adult muscle fibers may either be formed de novo from the fusion of the AMPs, or are created by the binding of AMPs to an existing larval muscle. While less is known about adult muscle specification compared to the larva, expression of specific transcription factors is also important for its diversification. Increasingly, the mechanisms required for the diversification of fly muscle have found parallels in vertebrate systems and mark Drosophila as a robust model system to examine questions about how diverse cell types are generated within an organism.},

OBJECTIVE To define the sleep and circadian phenotype of patients with early-stage Parkinson disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Initial assessment of sleep characteristics in a large population-representative incident Parkinson disease cohort (N=239) at the University of Cambridge, England, followed by further comprehensive case-control sleep assessments in a subgroup of these patients (n=30) and matched controls (n=15). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sleep diagnoses and sleep architecture based on polysomnography studies, actigraphy assessment, and 24-hour analyses of serum cortisol, melatonin, and peripheral clock gene expression (Bmal1, Per2, and Rev-Erb$\alpha$). RESULTS Subjective sleep complaints were present in almost half of newly diagnosed patients and correlated significantly with poorer quality of life. Patients with Parkinson disease exhibited increased sleep latency (P = .04), reduced sleep efficiency (P = .008), and reduced rapid eye movement sleep (P = .02). In addition, there was a sustained elevation of serum cortisol levels, reduced circulating melatonin levels, and altered Bmal1 expression in patients with Parkinson disease compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Sleep dysfunction seen in early Parkinson disease may reflect a more fundamental pathology in the molecular clock underlying circadian rhythms.},

In this study, we identify six regions of the Drosophila brain essential for dialect training. We pinpoint subgroups of neurons in these regions, including motion detecting neurons in the optic lobe, layer 5 of the fan-shaped body, the D glomerulus in the antennal lobe, and the odorant receptor Or69a, where activation of each component is necessary for dialect learning.

abstract = {Summary To distinguish between complex somatosensory stimuli, central circuits must combine signals from multiple peripheral mechanoreceptor types, as well as mechanoreceptors at different sites in the body. Here, we investigate the first stages of somatosensory integration in Drosophila using in vivo recordings from genetically labeled central neurons in combination with mechanical and optogenetic stimulation of specific mechanoreceptor types. We identify three classes of central neurons that process touch: one compares touch signals on different parts of the same limb, one compares touch signals on right and left limbs, and the third compares touch and proprioceptive signals. Each class encodes distinct features of somatosensory stimuli. The axon of an individual touch receptor neuron can diverge to synapse onto all three classes, meaning that these computations occur in parallel, not hierarchically. Representing a stimulus as a set of parallel comparisons is a fast and efficient way to deliver somatosensory signals to motor circuits.},

The drug did not improve scores in a task requiring cued recall of verbal information. The selectivity of drug effects on memory was confirmed using tests of visual recognition, motor performance, and general intellectual functioning. These results suggest that positive modulators of AMPA receptors selectively improve at least some aspects of memory.},

abstract = {High-frequency stimulation (HFS) induces long-term potentiation (LTP) at inhibitory synapses of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in developing rat visual cortex. This LTP requires postsynaptic Ca2+ rise for induction, while the maintenance mechanism is present at the presynaptic site, suggesting presynaptic LTP expression and the necessity of retrograde signaling. We investigated whether the supposed signal is mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is expressed in pyramidal neurons but not inhibitory interneurons. LTP did not occur when HFS was applied in the presence of the Trk receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a in the perfusion medium. HFS produced LTP when bath application of K252a was started after HFS or when K252a was loaded into postsynaptic cells. LTP did not occur in the presence of TrkB-IgG scavenging BDNF or function-blocking anti-BDNF antibody in the medium. In cells loaded with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA, the addition of BDNF to the medium enabled HFS to induce LTP without affecting baseline synaptic transmission. These results suggest that BDNF released from postsynaptic cells activates presynaptic TrkB, leading to LTP. Because BDNF, expressed activity dependently, regulates the maturation of cortical inhibition, inhibitory LTP may contribute to this developmental process, and hence experience-dependent functional maturation of visual cortex. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.},

abstract = {The fruitless (fru) gene acts in the central nervous system (CNS) of Drosophila melanogaster to establish male sexual behavior. Genetic dissection of the locus has shown that one of the fru gene's promoter, P1, controls the spatial and temporal expression of male-specific FruM proteins critical to determining stereotypical male sexual behavior. By using the Gal4-expression system, we show that a 16-kb fragment of the fru P1 promoter's 5' regulatory region drives the expression of Gal4 in a subset of FruM-expressing neurons within both the pupal and adult CNS. Colocalization of FruM and a Gal4-responsive reporter shows that the fru(P1)-gal4 fusion construct generates expression in both previously characterized FruM-expressing neurons as well as within cells of both the CNS and the peripheral nervous system that have not been demonstrated as FruM-expressing. Gal4-expressing neurons are shown to innervate abdominal organs directly relevant to fru function; specifically, the muscle of Lawrence (MOL) and the male internal reproductive organs. Innervations of the latter are shown to originate from identified FruM-serotonergic neurons. Furthermore, we show that the MOL neuromuscular junction is sexually dimorphic. Finally, we describe Gal4 expression in neurites innervating male reproductive structures that are hypothesized to be targets of fru function. Isolation of the regulatory sequences controlling the expression of fru in the CNS, therefore, provides a potent tool for the manipulation of FruM-expressing neurons and for understanding the cellular basis of Drosophila reproductive behavior.},

abstract = {Similarities in neocortical circuit organization across areas and species suggest a common strategy to process diverse types of information, including sensation from diverse modalities, motor control and higher cognitive processes. Cortical neurons belong to a small number of main classes. The properties of these classes, including their local and long-range connectivity, developmental history, gene expression, intrinsic physiology and in vivo activity patterns, are remarkably similar across areas. Each class contains subclasses; for a rapidly growing number of these, conserved patterns of input and output connections are also becoming evident. The ensemble of circuit connections constitutes a basic circuit pattern that appears to be repeated across neocortical areas, with area- and species-specific modifications. Such 'serially homologous' organization may adapt individual neocortical regions to the type of information each must process.},

Expression of c-fos and c-myc are among the earliest genetic events induced in cultured fibroblast and phaeochromocytoma cell lines by various stimuli including growth factors, peptides and the intracellular second messengers diacylglycerol, cAMP and Ca2+. We report here that physiological stimulation of rat primary sensory neurons causes the expression of c-fos-protein-like immunoreactivity in nuclei of postsynaptic neurons of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Activation of small-diameter cutaneous sensory afferents by noxious heat or chemical stimuli results in the rapid appearance of c-fos-protein-like immunoreactivity in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn. However, activation of low-threshold cutaneous afferents results in fewer labelled cells with a different laminar distribution. No c-fos induction was seen in the dorsal root ganglia, gracile nucleus or ventral horn. Thus, synaptic transmission may induce rapid changes in gene expression in certain postsynaptic neurons.},

abstract = {This study evaluated Fos-like immunoreactivity in lumbar spinal cord neurons following intense cold stimulation and then the modifications induced by opioid administration. Under urethane anaesthesia, the rat's right foot was stimulated by holding it in a regulated temperature bath at 15, 10, 0, -10, -15, -17.5 or -20??C. There was no or little Fos-like immunoreactivity in lumbar spinal cord neurons when the paw was at temperatures between 15 and -10??C (0-5 Fos-like immunoreactive neurons/section). The threshold to induce consistent c-fos expression was -15??C. From -15 to -20??C, the number of Fos-like immunoreactive neurons increased with decreases in temperature. At -20??C, Fos-like immunoreactive neurons were numerous in L3 and L4 segments, in laminae I-II (???60 Fos-like immunoreactive neurons/section) and to a lesser extent in laminae V-VI (???20). Almost no Fos-like immunoreactivity was present in laminae III-IV ({\textless} 5). At -20??C, the number of Fos-like immunoreactive neurons increased with the duration of the stimulation. The number of Fos-like immunoreactive neurons induced by the cold stimulation temperatures was significantly decreased by pretreatment with 10 mg/kg s.c. morphine and moderately decreased by 5 mg/kg s.c. This effect was antagonized by the combined administration of morphine (10 mg/kg s.c.) and naloxone (2 mg/kg s.c.). Naloxone (2 mg/kg s.c.) significantly increased the number of Fos-like immunoreactive neurons induced by -20??C as compared to saline-injected rats. This study showed that Fos-like immunoreactivity distribution is in good agreement with the location of neurons receiving noxious inputs and that the threshold to induce c-fos expression with cold was unexpectedly low at -15??C. Taking into account, on the one hand, previous investigations using the same technique using noxious heat stimulation and, on the other hand, electrophysiological and psychophysiological studies using cold stimulation in animals and humans, our results suggest that Fos-like immunoreactivity induced by extremely cold stimulation, which seems to reproduce frostbite, may reflect activation of nociceptors due to vasoconstriction. ?? 1994.},

We used a c-fos-based transgenic approach to introduce the hM(3)D(q) DREADD receptor (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug) into neurons naturally activated by sensory experience. Neural activity could then be specifically and inducibly increased in the hM(3)D(q)-expressing neurons by an exogenous ligand. When an ensemble of neurons for one context (ctxA) was artificially activated during conditioning in a distinct second context (ctxB), mice formed a hybrid memory representation. Reactivation of the artificially stimulated network within the conditioning context was required for retrieval of the memory, and the memory was specific for the spatial pattern of neurons artificially activated during learning. Similar stimulation impaired recall when not part of the initial conditioning.},

abstract = {Although the formalin test is a widely used model of persistent pain, the primary afferent fiber types that underlie the cellular and behavioral responses to formalin injection are largely unknown. Here we used a combined genetic and pharmacological approach to investigate the effect of ablating subsets of primary afferent nociceptors on formalin-induced nocifensive behaviors and spinal cord Fos protein expression. Intrathecal capsaicin-induced ablation of the central terminals of TRPV1 + neurons greatly reduced the behavioral responses and Fos elicited by low-dose (0.5{\%}) formalin. In contrast, genetic ablation of the MrgprD-expressing subset of non-peptidergic unmyelinated afferents, which constitute a largely non-overlapping population, altered neither the behavior nor the Fos induced by low-dose formalin. Remarkably, nocifensive behavior following high-dose (2{\%}) formalin was unchanged in mice lacking either afferent population, or even in mice lacking both populations, which together make up the great majority of C-fiber nociceptors. Thus, at high doses, which are routinely used in the formalin test, formalin-induced "pain" behavior persists in the absence of the vast majority of C-fiber nociceptors, which points to a contribution of a large spectrum of afferents secondary to non-specific formalin-induced tissue and nerve damage. ?? 2010 International Association for the Study of Pain.

This protocol allows determination of two aspects of courtship in Drosophila: to assess whether there is a deficiency in mating frequency and, if this is the case, to resolve the nature of the specific problem. The first part of the approach provides a simple, objective, high-throughput strategy that is ideal for determining whether a specific strain has any courtship defect. Any strain that mates at a frequency comparable to that of wild-type flies must be considered reasonably fit in an evolutionary sense. If a specific strain has an abnormal mating frequency, we are then interested in determining whether there is a specific courtship defect, as described in the second half of the protocol.

abstract = {The protooncogene c-fos is rapidly activated after noxious stimuli to express the protein Fos in spinal dorsal horn neurons that are in the 'correct' locations for nociceptive information transfer. As such, therefore, mapping Fos expression in these neurons is at present the best global marker for efficiently locating populations of neurons in the awake animal that respond to nociceptive input. This allows, among other things, precise behavioral measurements to be correlated with Fos expression. Two arenas where mapping dorsal horn Fos expression has made a major impact are in the anatomy of nociceptive systems and as a useful assay for the analgesic properties of various therapeutic regimens. Also Fos expression is the only way to map populations of neurons that are responding to non-localized input such as withdrawal after addiction and vascular occlusion. Another insight is that it shows a clear activation of neurons in superficial 'pain-processing' laminae by innocuous stimuli after nerve lesions, a finding that presumably bears on the allodynia that often accompanies these lesions. It is to be understood, however, that the Fos localizations are not sufficient unto themselves, but the major function of these studies is to efficiently locate populations of cells in nociceptive pathways so that powerful anatomic and physiologic techniques can be brought to bear efficiently. Thus, the purpose of this review is to summarize the studies whose numbers are geometrically expanding that deal with Fos in the dorsal horn and the conclusions therefrom. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Within each spinal segment, multiple motor neuron classes arise from a common progenitor population; however, the mechanisms underlying their diversification remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the Forkhead domain transcription factor Foxp1 plays a critical role in defining the columnar identity of motor neurons at each axial position. Using genetic manipulations, we demonstrate that Foxp1 establishes the pattern of LIM-HD protein expression and accordingly organizes motor axon projections, their connectivity with peripheral targets, and the establishment of motor pools. These functions of Foxp1 act in accordance with the rostrocaudal pattern provided by Hox proteins along the length of the spinal cord, suggesting a model by which motor neuron diversity is achieved through the coordinated actions of Foxp1 and Hox proteins. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

We found that mutation of a single miRNA locus (miR-iab4/iab8) in Drosophila larvae affects the animal's capacity to correct its orientation if turned upside down (self-righting). One of the miRNA targets involved in this behavior is the Hox gene Ultrabithorax, whose derepression in two metameric neurons leads to self-righting defects. In vivo neural activity analysis reveals that these neurons, the self-righting node (SRN), have different activity patterns in wild type and miRNA mutants, whereas thermogenetic manipulation of SRN activity results in changes in self-righting behavior. Our work thus reveals a miRNA-encoded behavior and suggests that other miRNAs might also be involved in behavioral control in Drosophila and other species.},

Med is part of a presynaptic bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling cascade consisting of three receptor subunits, Wit, Tkv, and Sax, in addition to the Smad transcription factor Mad. When compared to wild-type, mutants of BMP signaling components have smaller NMJ size, reduced neurotransmitter release, and aberrant synaptic ultrastructure. BMP signaling mutants suppress the excessive synaptic growth in hiw mutants. Activation of BMP signaling, which in wild-type does not cause additional growth, in hiw mutants does lead to further synaptic expansion. These results reveal a balance between positive BMP signaling and negative regulation by Highwire, governing the growth of neuromuscular synapses.},

abstract = {Experiments were conducted using hippocampal slices in vitro to compare two accounts of the mechanisms by which input-specific protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation (late-LTP) may be realised. The synaptic tag hypothesis (Frey and Morris, 1997) predicts that the expression of early-LTP following a weak tetanus can be stabilised into late-LTP subsequent strong tetanisation of a separate pathway, provided the interval between the two tetanisation episodes is within the decay time-course of a putative synaptic tag. An alternative plasticity-factors hypothesis requires that strong tetanisation should always precede weak tetanisation for stabilisation of early-LTP to occur. Our results indicate that weak tetanisation of pathway S2 at intervals of 5 min or 1 h prior to strong tetanisation on pathway S1 does result in late-LTP on pathway S2. Stabilisation was weaker or did not occur at intervals of 2 and 4 h. This stabilisation effect was shown to depend on protein synthesis during the strong tetanisation of S1. These findings uphold a key prediction of the synaptic tag hypothesis and have implications for the functional role of synaptic tagging for cortical plasticity.},

abstract = {Sequences of motor activity are encoded in many vertebrate brains by complex spatio-temporal patterns of neural activity; however, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying the generation of these pre-motor patterns are poorly understood. In songbirds, one prominent site of pre-motor activity is the forebrain robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), which generates stereotyped sequences of spike bursts during song and recapitulates these sequences during sleep. We show that the stereotyped sequences in RA are driven from nucleus HVC (high vocal centre), the principal pre-motor input to RA. Recordings of identified HVC neurons in sleeping and singing birds show that individual HVC neurons projecting onto RA neurons produce bursts sparsely, at a single, precise time during the RA sequence. These HVC neurons burst sequentially with respect to one another. We suggest that at each time in the RA sequence, the ensemble of active RA neurons is driven by a subpopulation of RA-projecting HVC neurons that is active only at that time. As a population, these HVC neurons may form an explicit representation of time in the sequence. Such a sparse representation, a temporal analogue of the 'grandmother cell' concept for object recognition, eliminates the problem of temporal interference during sequence generation and learning attributed to more distributed representations.},

abstract = {We have designed a real-time computer vision system, the Multi-Worm Tracker (MWT), that can simultaneously quantify the behavior of dozens of Caenorhabditis elegans on a traditional petri plate at video rates. Three traditional behavioral paradigms are examined using this system: spontaneous movement on food, where the behavior changes over tens of minutes; chemotaxis, where turning events must be detected accurately to determine strategy; and habituation of response to tap, where the response is stochastic and changes over time. In each case, manual analysis or automated single-worm tracking would be tedious and time-consuming, but the MWT system allows rapid quantification of behavior with minimal human effort. Thus, this system will enablelarge scale forward and reverse genetic screens for complex behaviors. Since Caenorhabditis elegans was introduced as a model organism, a large number of mutants in genes that modulate easily-scored behaviors have been isolated in genetic screens. However, it has been challenging to manually screen for behaviors that unfold over long periods of time, that are difficult to score quickly and accurately by eye, or that manifest stochastically. Thus, there is a need for high-throughput automated techniques that can be used on such behaviors.},

The conserved sequence falls within the previously defined P-region of voltage-activated K+ channels. In this study we investigate the effect of mutations in the signature sequence of the Shaker channel on K+ selectivity determined under bi-ionic conditions. Nonconservative substitutions of two threonine residues and the tyrosine residue leave selectivity intact. In contrast, mutations at some positions render the channel nonselective among monovalent cations. These findings are consistent with a proposal that the signature sequence contributes to a selectivity filter. Furthermore, the results illustrate that the hydroxyl groups at the third and fourth positions, and the aromatic group at position seven, are not essential in determining K+ selectivity.},

abstract = {Excessive activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors increases oxidative stress, contributing to the neuronal death observed following neurological insults such as ischemia and seizures. Post-translational histone modifications may be key mediators in the detection and repair of damage resulting from oxidative stress, including DNA damage, and may thus affect neuronal survival in the aftermath of insults characterized by excessive glutamate release. In non-neuronal cells, phosphorylation of histone variant H2A.X (termed gamma-H2AX) occurs rapidly following DNA double-strand breaks. We investigated gamma-H2AX formation in rat cortical neurons (days in vitro 14) following activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate glutamate receptors using fluorescent immunohistochemical techniques. Moreover, we evaluated the co-localization of gamma-H2AX 'foci' with Mre11, a double-strand break repair protein, to provide further evidence for the activation of this DNA damage response pathway. Here we show that minimally cytotoxic stimulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors was sufficient to evoke gamma-H2AX in neurons, and that NMDA-induced gamma-H2AX foci formation was attenuated by pretreatment with the antioxidant, Vitamin E, and the intracellular calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM. Moreover, a subset of gamma-H2AX foci co-localized with Mre11, indicating that at least a portion of gamma-H2AX foci is damage dependent. The extent of gamma-H2AX induction following glutamate receptor activation corresponded to the increases we observed following conventional DNA damaging agents [i.e. non-lethal doses of gamma-radiation (1 Gy) and hydrogen peroxide (10 microm)]. These data suggest that insults not necessarily resulting in neuronal death induce the DNA damage-evoked chromatin modification, gamma-H2AX, and implicate a role for histone alterations in determining neuronal vulnerability following neurological insults.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is a complex disorder that interferes with the function of several brain systems required for cognition and normal social behaviour. Although the most notable clinical aspects of the disease only become apparent during late adolescence or early adulthood, many lines of evidence suggest that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic component. Several independent studies have identified neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its receptor ERBB4 as important risk genes for schizophrenia, although their precise role in the disease process remains unknown. Here we show that Nrg1 and ErbB4 signalling controls the development of inhibitory circuitries in the mammalian cerebral cortex by cell-autonomously regulating the connectivity of specific GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-containing interneurons. In contrast to the prevalent view, which supports a role for these genes in the formation and function of excitatory synapses between pyramidal cells, we found that ErbB4 expression in the mouse neocortex and hippocampus is largely confined to certain classes of interneurons. In particular, ErbB4 is expressed by many parvalbumin-expressing chandelier and basket cells, where it localizes to axon terminals and postsynaptic densities receiving glutamatergic input. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments, both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrate that ErbB4 cell-autonomously promotes the formation of axo-axonic inhibitory synapses over pyramidal cells, and that this function is probably mediated by Nrg1. In addition, ErbB4 expression in GABA-containing interneurons regulates the formation of excitatory synapses onto the dendrites of these cells. By contrast, ErbB4 is dispensable for excitatory transmission between pyramidal neurons. Altogether, our results indicate that Nrg1 and ErbB4 signalling is required for the wiring of GABA-mediated circuits in the postnatal cortex, providing a new perspective to the involvement of these genes in the aetiology of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Although most projection neurons in lamina I express the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1r), we have identified a population of large multipolar projection cells that lack the NK1r, are characterized by the high density of gephyrin puncta that coat their cell bodies and dendrites, and express the transcription factor Fos in response to noxious chemical stimulation. Here we show that these cells have a very high density of glutamatergic input from axons with strong immunoreactivity for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 that are likely to originate from excitatory interneurons. However, they receive few contacts from peptidergic primary afferents or transganglionically labeled Adelta nociceptors. Unlike most glutamatergic synapses in superficial laminas, those on the gephyrin-coated cells contain the GluR4 subunit of the AMPA receptor. A noxious heat stimulus caused Fos expression in 38{\%} of the gephyrin-coated cells but in 85{\%} of multipolar NK1r-immunoreactive cells. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that there is a correlation between function and morphology for lamina I neurons but indicate that there are at least two populations of multipolar neurons that differ in receptor expression, excitatory inputs, and responses to noxious stimulation. Although there are only approximately 10 gephyrin-coated cells on each side per segment in the lumbar enlargement, they constitute approximately 18{\%} of the lamina I component of the spinothalamic tract at this level, which suggests that they play an important role in transmission of nociceptive information to the cerebral cortex. Our results also provide the first evidence that postsynaptic GluR4-containing AMPA receptors are involved in spinal nociceptive transmission.},

abstract = {In most tissues, cell division is coordinated with increases in mass (i.e., growth). To understand this coordination, we altered rates of division in cell clones or compartments of the Drosophila wing and measured the effects on growth. Constitutive overproduction of the transcriptional regulator dE2F increased expression of the S- and M-phase initiators Cyclin E and String (Cdc25), thereby accelerating cell proliferation. Loss of dE2F or overproduction of its corepressor, RBF, retarded cell proliferation. These manipulations altered cell numbers over a 4- to 5-fold range but had little effect on clone or compartment sizes. Instead, changes in cell division rates were offset by changes in cell size. We infer that dE2F and RBF function specifically in cell cycle control, and that cell cycle acceleration is insufficient to stimulate growth. Variations in dE2F activity could be used to coordinate cell division with growth.},

This is the first time that such a device has been used with a healthy human. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy, compatibility, and long term operability of the neural implant in allowing the subject to perceive feedback stimulation and for neural activity to be detected and processed such that the subject could interact with remote technologies. A case study demonstrating real-time control of an instrumented prosthetic hand by means of the bi-directional link is given. The implantation did not result in infection, and scanning electron microscope images of the implant post extraction have not indicated significant rejection of the implant by the body. No perceivable loss of hand sensation or motion control was experienced by the subject while the implant was in place, and further testing of the subject following the removal of the implant has not indicated any measurable long term defects.

The neural mechanisms responsible for cognitive deficit and autism-spectrum behaviours in Dravet's syndrome are poorly understood. Here we report that mice with Scn1a haploinsufficiency exhibit hyperactivity, stereotyped behaviours, social interaction deficits and impaired context-dependent spatial memory. Olfactory sensitivity is retained, but novel food odours and social odours are aversive to Scn1a(+/-) mice. GABAergic neurotransmission is specifically impaired by this mutation, and selective deletion of Na(V)1.1 channels in forebrain interneurons is sufficient to cause these behavioural and cognitive impairments. Remarkably, treatment with low-dose clonazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptors, completely rescued the abnormal social behaviours and deficits in fear memory in the mouse model of Dravet's syndrome, demonstrating that they are caused by impaired GABAergic neurotransmission and not by neuronal damage from recurrent seizures. These results demonstrate a critical role for Na(V)1.1 channels in neuropsychiatric functions and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for cognitive deficit and autism-spectrum behaviours in Dravet's syndrome.},

In mammals and invertebrates, learned fear responses can be suppressed by experiencing predictive cues without punishment, a process called memory extinction. Here, we show that extinction of aversive memories in Drosophila requires specific dopaminergic neurons, which indicate that omission of punishment is remembered as a positive experience. Functional imaging revealed co-existence of intracellular calcium traces in different places in the mushroom body output neuron network for both the original aversive memory and a new appetitive extinction memory. Light and ultrastructural anatomy are consistent with parallel competing memories being combined within mushroom body output neurons that direct avoidance. Indeed, extinction-evoked plasticity in a pair of these neurons neutralizes the potentiated odor response imposed in the network by aversive learning. Therefore, flies track the accuracy of learned expectations by accumulating and integrating memories of conflicting events.},

These mice showed profound scratching deficits in response to all of the itching (pruritogenic) stimuli tested, irrespective of their histamine dependence. In contrast, pain behaviors were unaffected. Our data also suggest that GRPR+ neurons are different from the spinothalamic tract neurons that have been the focus of the debate.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness, compatibility, and long-term operability of a microelectrode array into the median nerve of the left arm of a healthy volunteer, including perception of feedback stimulation and operation of an instrumented prosthetic hand. SETTING: The study was carried out from March 14 through June 18, 2002, in England and the United States. RESULTS: The blindfolded subject received feedback information, obtained from force and slip sensors on the prosthetic hand, and subsequently used the implanted device to control the hand by applying an appropriate force to grip an unseen object. Operability was also demonstrated remotely via the Internet, with the subject in New York, NY, and the prosthetic hand in Reading, England. Finally, the subject was able to control an electric wheelchair, via decoded signals from the implant device, to select the direction of travel by opening and closing his hand. The implantation did not result in infection or any perceivable loss of hand sensation or motion control. The implant was finally extracted because of mechanical fatigue of the percutaneous connection. Further testing after extraction has not indicated any measurable long-term defects in the subject. CONCLUSIONS: This implant may allow recipients to have abilities they would otherwise not possess. The response to stimulation improved considerably during the trial, suggesting that the subject learned to process the incoming information more effectively.},

abstract = {Within the mammalian hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) contains a circadian clock for timing of diverse neuronal, endocrine, and behavioral rhythms. By culturing cells from neonatal rat SCN on fixed microelectrode arrays, we have been able to record spontaneous action potentials from individual SCN neurons for days or weeks, revealing prominent circadian rhythms in firing rate. Despite abundant functional synapses, circadian rhythms expressed by neurons in the same culture are not synchronized. After reversible blockade of neuronal firing lasting 2.5 days, circadian firing rhythms re-emerge with unaltered phases. These data suggest that the SCN contains a large population of autonomous, single-cell circadian oscillators, and that synapses formed in vitro are neither necessary for operation of these oscillators nor sufficient for synchronizing them.},

In contrast, short-term memory, lasting between 30 and 60 min, is normal. Consistent with models claiming a role for long-term potentiation (LTP) in memory, LTP in hippocampal slices from CREB mutants decayed to baseline 90 min after tetanic stimulation.

Sensory neurons rely on the musculotopic organization of motorneurons to establish orderly connections, prompting us to examine whether the intraspinal circuitry that coordinates motor activity likewise uses cell position as an internal wiring reference. We generated a motorneuron-specific GCaMP6f mouse line and employed two-photon imaging to monitor the activity of lumbar motorneurons. We show that the central pattern generator neural network coordinately drives rhythmic columnar-specific motorneuron bursts at distinct phases of the locomotor cycle. Using multiple genetic strategies to perturb the subtype identity and orderly position of motorneurons, we found that neurons retained their rhythmic activity-but cell position was decoupled from the normal phasing pattern underlying flexion and extension. These findings suggest a hierarchical basis of motor circuit formation that relies on increasingly stringent matching of neuronal identity and position.},

Application of optogenetics(7,8) in the larval neural circuit allows us to manipulate neuronal activity in spatially and temporally patterned ways(9-13). Typically, specimens are broadly illuminated with a mercury lamp or LED, so specificity of the target neurons is controlled by binary gene expression systems such as the Gal4-UAS system(14,15). In this work, to improve the spatial resolution to "sub-genetic resolution", we locally illuminated a subset of neurons in the ventral nerve cord using lasers implemented in a conventional confocal microscope. While monitoring the motion of the body wall of the semi-intact larvae, we interactively activated or inhibited neural activity with channelrhodopsin(16,17) or halorhodopsin(18-20), respectively. By spatially and temporally restricted illumination of the neural tissue, we can manipulate the activity of specific neurons in the circuit at a specific phase of behavior. This method is useful for studying the relationship between the activities of a local neural assembly in the ventral nerve cord and the spatiotemporal pattern of motor output.},

CLaP uses laser illumination to crosslink biotin onto the plasma membrane, coupled with streptavidin conjugates to label individual cells for genomic, cell-tracking, flow cytometry or ultra-microscopy applications. We show that the incorporated mark is stable, non-toxic, retained for several days, and transferred by cell division but not to adjacent cells in culture. To demonstrate the potential of CLaP for genomic applications, we combine CLaP with microfluidics-based single-cell capture followed by transcriptome-wide next-generation sequencing. Finally, we show that CLaP can also be exploited for inducing transient cell adhesion to substrates for microengineering cultures with spatially patterned cell types.},

abstract = {Anxiety--a sustained state of heightened apprehension in the absence of immediate threat--becomes severely debilitating in disease states. Anxiety disorders represent the most common of psychiatric diseases (28{\%} lifetime prevalence) and contribute to the aetiology of major depression and substance abuse. Although it has been proposed that the amygdala, a brain region important for emotional processing, has a role in anxiety, the neural mechanisms that control anxiety remain unclear. Here we explore the neural circuits underlying anxiety-related behaviours by using optogenetics with two-photon microscopy, anxiety assays in freely moving mice, and electrophysiology. With the capability of optogenetics to control not only cell types but also specific connections between cells, we observed that temporally precise optogenetic stimulation of basolateral amygdala (BLA) terminals in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA)--achieved by viral transduction of the BLA with a codon-optimized channelrhodopsin followed by restricted illumination in the downstream CeA--exerted an acute, reversible anxiolytic effect. Conversely, selective optogenetic inhibition of the same projection with a third-generation halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) increased anxiety-related behaviours. Importantly, these effects were not observed with direct optogenetic control of BLA somata, possibly owing to recruitment of antagonistic downstream structures. Together, these results implicate specific BLA-CeA projections as critical circuit elements for acute anxiety control in the mammalian brain, and demonstrate the importance of optogenetically targeting defined projections, beyond simply targeting cell types, in the study of circuit function relevant to neuropsychiatric disease.},

abstract = {Nociceptive sensitization is a conserved form of neuronal plasticity that serves an important survival function, as it fosters behavior that protects damaged tissue during healing. This sensitization may involve a lowering of the nociceptive threshold (allodynia) or an increased response to normally noxious stimuli (hyperalgesia). Although nociceptive sensitization has been intensively studied in vertebrate models, an open question in the field is the extent to which allodynia and hyperalgesia, which almost always occur in tandem, are truly separate events at the mechanistic level. We recently introduced a genetically tractable model for damage-induced nociceptive sensitization in Drosophila larvae, and identified a conserved cytokine signaling module that mediates development of allodynia following UV irradiation. This pathway includes the Drosophila homolog of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNFalpha), Eiger, which is released from damaged epidermal cells and acts directly on its receptor, Wengen, located on nociceptive sensory neurons. Here we show that although Eiger and Wengen are both required for the development of thermal allodynia, they are dispensable for thermal hyperalgesia, suggesting, contrary to what is commonly assumed, that these two forms of hypersensitivity are initiated by separate genetic pathways.},

abstract = {The transmembrane protein deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and its ligand, netrin-1, regulate synaptogenesis during development, but their function in the mature central nervous system is unknown. Given that DCC promotes cell-cell adhesion, is expressed by neurons, and activates proteins that signal at synapses, we hypothesized that DCC expression by neurons regulates synaptic function and plasticity in the adult brain. We report that DCC is enriched in dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in wild-type mice, and we demonstrate that selective deletion of DCC from neurons in the adult forebrain results in the loss of long-term potentiation (LTP), intact long-term depression, shorter dendritic spines, and impaired spatial and recognition memory. LTP induction requires Src activation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function. DCC deletion severely reduced Src activation. We demonstrate that enhancing NMDAR function or activating Src rescues LTP in the absence of DCC. We conclude that DCC activation of Src is required for NMDAR-dependent LTP and certain forms of learning and memory. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {The deep dorsal horn is a poorly characterized spinal cord region implicated in processing low-threshold mechanoreceptor (LTMR) information. We report an array of mouse genetic tools for defining neuronal components and functions of the dorsal horn LTMR-recipient zone (LTMR-RZ), a role for LTMR-RZ processing in tactile perception, and the basic logic of LTMR-RZ organization. We found an unexpectedly high degree of neuronal diversity in the LTMR-RZ: seven excitatory and four inhibitory subtypes of interneurons exhibiting unique morphological, physiological, and synaptic properties. Remarkably, LTMRs form synapses on between four and 11 LTMR-RZ interneuron subtypes, while each LTMR-RZ interneuron subtype samples inputs from at least one to three LTMR classes, as well as spinal cord interneurons and corticospinal neurons. Thus, the LTMR-RZ is a somatosensory processing region endowed with a neuronal complexity that rivals the retina and functions to pattern the activity of ascending touch pathways that underlie tactile perception.},

abstract = {Cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillations are a universal signaling mode that activates numerous cellular responses [1, 2]. Oscillations are considered the physiological mechanism of Ca2+ signaling because they occur at low levels of stimulus intensity [3]. Ca2+ oscillations are proposed to convey information in their amplitude and frequency, leading to activation of specific downstream targets [4-6]. Here, we report that the spatial Ca2+ gradient within the oscillation is key. Ca2+ oscillations in mast cells evoked over a range of agonist concentrations in the presence of external Ca2+ were indistinguishable from those in the absence of Ca2+ when plasmalemmal Ca2+ extrusion was suppressed. Nevertheless, only oscillations with accompanying Ca2+ entry through store-operated CRAC channels triggered gene expression. Increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering prevented oscillations but not gene activation. Local Ca2+ influx and not global Ca2+ oscillations therefore drives gene expression at physiological levels of stimulation. Rather than serving to maintain Ca2+ oscillations by replenishing stores, we suggest that the role of oscillations might be to activate CRAC channels, thereby ensuring the generation of spatially restricted physiological Ca2+ signals driving gene activation. Furthermore, we show that the spatial profile of a Ca2+ oscillation provides a novel mechanism whereby a pleiotropic messenger specifically activates gene expression. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Sensory experience orchestrates the development ofcortical circuitry by adaptively modifying neurotransmission and synaptic connectivity. However, the mechanisms underlying these experience-dependent modifications remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that visual experience suppresses a presynaptic NMDA receptor (preNMDAR)-mediated form of timing-dependent long-term depression (tLTD) at visual cortex layer (L) 4-2/3 synapses. This tLTD can be maintained during development, or reinstated in adulthood, by sensory deprivation. The changes in tLTD are mirrored by changes in glutamate release; visual deprivation enhances both tLTD and glutamate release. These effects require the GluN3A NMDAR subunit, the levels of which are increased by visual deprivation. Further, by coupling the pathway-specific optogenetic induction of tLTD with cell-type-specific NMDAR deletion, we find that visual experience modifies preNMDAR-mediated plasticity specifically at L4-L2/3 synapses. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A rise in [Ca2+]i provides the trigger for neurotransmitter release at neuronal boutons. We have used confocal microscopy and Ca2+ sensitive dyes to directly measure the action potential-evoked [Ca2+]i in the boutons of Schaffer collaterals. This reveals that the trial-by-trial amplitude of the evoked Ca2+ transient is bimodally distributed. We demonstrate that " large" Ca2+ transients occur when presynaptic NMDA receptors are activated following transmitter release. Presynaptic NMDA receptor activation proves critical in producing facilitation of transmission at theta frequencies. Because large Ca2+ transients " report" transmitter release, their frequency on a trial-by-trial basis can be used to estimate the probability of release, pr. We use this novel estimator to show that pr increases following the induction of long-term potentiation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A specific memory is thought to be encoded by a sparse population of neurons. These neurons can be tagged during learning for subsequent identification and manipulation. Moreover, their ablation or inactivation results in reduced memory expression, suggesting their necessity in mnemonic processes. However, the question of sufficiency remains: it is unclear whether it is possible to elicit the behavioural output of a specific memory by directly activating a population of neurons that was active during learning. Here we show in mice that optogenetic reactivation of hippocampal neurons activated during fear conditioning is sufficient to induce freezing behaviour. We labelled a population of hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons activated during fear learning with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and later optically reactivated these neurons in a different context. The mice showed increased freezing only upon light stimulation, indicating light-induced fear memory recall. This freezing was not detected in non-fear-conditioned mice expressing ChR2 in a similar proportion of cells, nor in fear-conditioned mice with cells labelled by enhanced yellow fluorescent protein instead of ChR2. Finally, activation of cells labelled in a context not associated with fear did not evoke freezing in mice that were previously fear conditioned in a different context, suggesting that light-induced fear memory recall is context specific. Together, our findings indicate that activating a sparse but specific ensemble of hippocampal neurons that contribute to a memory engram is sufficient for the recall of that memory. Moreover, our experimental approach offers a general method of mapping cellular populations bearing memory engrams.},

abstract = {We have studied vertical synaptic pathways in two cytoarchitectonically distinct areas of rat neocortex--the granular primary somatosensory (SI) area and the agranular primary motor (MI) area--and tested their propensity to generate long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and related forms of synaptic plasticity. Extracellular and intracellular responses were recorded in layer II/III of slices in vitro while stimulating in middle cortical layers (in or around layer IV). Under control conditions, 5 Hz theta-burst stimulation produced LTP in the granular area, but not in the agranular area. Agranular cortex did generate short-term potentiation that decayed within 20 min. Varying the inter-burst frequency from 2 Hz to 10 Hz reliably yielded LTP of 21-34{\%} above control levels in granular cortex, but no lasting changes were induced in agranular cortex. However, the agranular cortex was capable of generating LTP if a GABAA receptor antagonist was applied locally at the recording site during the induction phase. In contrast to LTP, an identical form of homosynaptic LTD could be induced in both granular and agranular areas by applying low frequency stimulation (1 Hz for 15 min) to the middle layers. Under control conditions, both LTP and LTD were synapse-specific; theta-burst or low-frequency stimulation in the vertical pathway did not induce changes in responses to stimulation of a layer II/III horizontal pathway. Application of the NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP5) blocked the induction of both LTP and LTD in granular and agranular cortex. In the presence of AP5, low-frequency conditioning stimuli yielded a short-term depression in both areas that decayed within 10-15 min. Nifedipine, which blocks L-type, voltage-sensitive calcium channels, slightly depressed the magnitudes of LTP and LTD but did not abolish them. Synaptic responses evoked during theta-burst stimulation were strikingly different in granular and agranular areas. Responses in granular cortex were progressively facilitated during each sequence of 10 theta-bursts, and from sequence-to-sequence; in contrast, responses in agranular cortex were stable during an entire theta-burst tetanus. The results suggest that vertical pathways in primary somatosensory cortex and primary motor cortex express several forms of synaptic plasticity. They were equally capable of generating LTD, but the pathways in somatosensory cortex much more reliably generated LTP, unless inhibition was reduced. LTP may be more easily produced in sensory cortex because of the pronounced synaptic facilitation that occurs there during repetitive stimulation of the induction phase.},

The endogenous circadian cycle is entrained to the light/dark via direct glutamatergic retinal afferents to the SCN. To understand the molecular basis of entrainment, it is first necessary to define how rapidly the clock is reset by a light pulse. We used a two-pulse paradigm, in combination with cellular and behavioral analyses of SCN function, to explore the speed of resetting of the circadian oscillator in Syrian hamster and mouse. Analysis of c-fos induction and cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation in the retinorecipient SCN demonstrated that the SCN are able to resolve and respond to light pulses presented 1 or 2 hr apart. Analysis of the phase shifts of the circadian wheel-running activity rhythm of hamsters presented with single or double pulses demonstrated that resetting of the oscillator occurred within 2 hr. This was the case for both delaying and advancing phase shifts. Examination of delaying shifts in the mouse showed resetting within 2 hr and in addition showed that resetting is not completed within 1 hr of a light pulse. These results establish the temporal window within which to define the primary molecular mechanisms of circadian resetting in the mammal.},

We performed linkage analysis in a Chinese family with primary erythermalgia, and screened the mutations in the two candidate genes, SCN9A and GCA, in the family and a sporadic patient. Linkage analysis yielded a maximum lod score of 2.11 for both markers D2S2370 and D2S2330. Based on critical recombination events in two patients in the family, we further limited the genetic region to 5.98 cM between D2S2370 and D2S2345. We then identified two missense mutations in SCN9A in the family (T2573A) and the sporadic patient (T2543C). Our data suggest that mutations in SCN9A cause primary erythermalgia.

abstract = {Recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have rapidly advanced to the forefront of gene therapy in the past decade. The exponential progress of AAV-based vectors has been made possible by the isolation of several naturally occurring AAV serotypes and over 100 AAV variants from different animal species. These isolates are ideally suited to development into human gene therapy vectors due to their diverse tissue tropisms and potential to evade preexisting neutralizing antibodies against the common human AAV serotype 2. Despite their prolific application in several animal models of disease, the mechanisms underlying selective tropisms of AAV serotypes remain largely unknown. Efforts to understand cell surface receptor usage and intracellular trafficking pathways exploited by AAV continue to provide significant insight into the biology of AAV vectors. Such unique traits are thought to arise from differences in surface topology of the capsids of AAV serotypes and variants. In addition to the aforementioned naturally evolved AAV isolates, several strategies to engineer hybrid AAV serotype vectors have been formulated in recent years. The generation of mosaic or chimeric vectors through the transcapsidation or marker-rescue/domain-swapping approach, respectively, is notable in this regard. More recently, combinatorial strategies for engineering AAV vectors using error-prone PCR, DNA shuffling, and other molecular cloning techniques have been established. The latter library-based approaches can serve as powerful tools in the generation of low-immunogenic and cell/tissue type-specific AAV vectors for gene delivery. This review is focused on recent developments in the isolation of novel AAV serotypes and isolates, their production and purification, diverse tissue tropisms, mechanisms of cellular entry/trafficking, and capsid structure. Strategies for engineering hybrid AAV vectors derived from AAV serotypes and potential implications of the rapidly expanding AAV vector toolkit are discussed. ?? 2006 The American Society of Gene Therapy.},

abstract = {Maladaptive plasticity within the dorsal horn (DH) of the spinal cord is a key substrate for development of neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury. Advances in genetic engineering, tracing techniques and opto-genetics are leading to a much better understanding of the complex circuitry of the spinal DH and the radical changes evoked in such circuitry by nerve injury. These changes can be viewed at multiple levels including: synaptic remodeling including enhanced excitatory and reduced inhibitory drive, morphological and electrophysiological changes which are observed both to primary afferent inputs as well as DH neurons, and ultimately circuit-level rewiring which leads to altered connectivity and aberrant processing of sensory inputs in the DH. The DH should not be seen in isolation but is subject to important descending modulation from the brainstem, which is further dysregulated by nerve injury. Understanding which changes relate to specific disease-states is essential, and recent work has aimed to stratify patient populations in a mechanistic fashion. In this review we will discuss how such pathophysiological mechanisms may lead to the distressing sensory phenomena experienced by patients suffering neuropathic pain, and the relationship of such mechanisms to current and potential future treatment modalities.},

abstract = {Receptive fields of sensory cortical neurons are plastic, changing in response to alterations of neural activity or sensory experience. In this way, cortical representations of the sensory environment can incorporate new information about the world, depending on the relevance or value of particular stimuli. Neuromodulation is required for cortical plasticity, but it is uncertain how subcortical neuromodulatory systems, such as the cholinergic nucleus basalis, interact with and refine cortical circuits. Here we determine the dynamics of synaptic receptive field plasticity in the adult primary auditory cortex (also known as AI) using in vivo whole-cell recording. Pairing sensory stimulation with nucleus basalis activation shifted the preferred stimuli of cortical neurons by inducing a rapid reduction of synaptic inhibition within seconds, which was followed by a large increase in excitation, both specific to the paired stimulus. Although nucleus basalis was stimulated only for a few minutes, reorganization of synaptic tuning curves progressed for hours thereafter: inhibition slowly increased in an activity-dependent manner to rebalance the persistent enhancement of excitation, leading to a retuned receptive field with new preference for the paired stimulus. This restricted period of disinhibition may be a fundamental mechanism for receptive field plasticity, and could serve as a memory trace for stimuli or episodes that have acquired new behavioural significance.},

abstract = {Projections to the forebrain from lamina I of spinal and trigeminal dorsal horn were labeled anterogradely with Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and/or tetramethylrhodamine-dextran (RHO-D) injected microiontophoretically. Injections restricted to superficial laminae (I/II) of dorsal horn were used primarily. For comparison, injections were also made in deep cervical laminae. Spinal and trigeminal lamina I neurons project extensively to restricted portions of the ventral posterolateral and posteromedial (VPL/VPM), and the posterior group (Po) thalamic nuclei. Lamina I also projects to the triangular posterior (PoT) and the ventral posterior parvicellular (VPPC) thalamic nuclei but only very slightly to the extrathalamic forebrain. Furthermore, the lateral spinal (LS) nucleus, and to a lesser extent lamina I, project to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. In contrast to lamina I, deep spinal laminae project primarily to the central lateral thalamic nucleus (CL) and only weakly to the remaining thalamus, except for a medium projection to the PoT. Furthermore, the deep laminae project substantially to the globus pallidus and the substantia innominata and more weakly to the amygdala and the hypothalamus. Double-labeling experiments reveal that spinal and trigeminal lamina I project densely to distinct and restricted portions of VPL/VPM, Po, and VPPC thalamic nuclei, whereas projections to the PoT appeared to be convergent. In conclusion, these experiments indicate very different patterns of projection for lamina I versus deep laminae (III-X). Lamina I projects strongly onto relay thalamic nuclei and thus would have a primary role in sensory discriminative aspects of pain. The deep laminae project densely to the CL and more diffusely to other forebrain targets, suggesting roles in motor and alertness components of pain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: How the central nervous system (CNS) develops to implement innate behaviors remains largely unknown. Drosophila male sexual behavior has long been used as a model to address this question. The male-specific products of fruitless (fru) are pivotal to the emergence of this behavior. These putative transcription factors, containing one of three alternative DNA binding domains, determine the neuronal substrates for sexual behavior in male CNS.

RESULTS: We isolated the first fru coding mutation, resulting in complete loss of one isoform. At the neuronal level, this isoform alone controls differentiation of a male-specific muscle and its associated motorneuron. Conversely, a combination of isoforms is required for development of serotonergic neurons implicated in male copulatory behavior. Full development of these neurons requires the male-specific product of doublesex, a gene previously thought to act independently of fru. At the behavioral level, missing one isoform leads to diminished courtship behavior and infertility. We achieved the first rescue of a distinct fru behavioral phenotype, expressing a wild-type isoform in a defined subset of its normal expression pattern.

CONCLUSION: This study exemplifies how complex behaviors can be controlled by a single locus through multiple isoforms regulating both developmental and physiological pathways in different neuronal substrates.},

To overcome this constraint, we developed new devices that integrate ultrathin and flexible silicon nanomembrane transistors into the electrode array, enabling new dense arrays of thousands of amplified and multiplexed sensors that are connected using fewer wires. We used this system to record spatial properties of cat brain activity in vivo, including sleep spindles, single-trial visual evoked responses and electrographic seizures. We found that seizures may manifest as recurrent spiral waves that propagate in the neocortex. The developments reported here herald a new generation of diagnostic and therapeutic brain-machine interface devices.},

abstract = {Hippocampal NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity are widely considered crucial substrates of long-term spatial memory, although their precise role remains uncertain. Here we show that Grin1$\Delta$DGCA1 mice, lacking GluN1 and hence NMDARs in all dentate gyrus and dorsal CA1 principal cells, acquired the spatial reference memory water maze task as well as controls, despite impairments on the spatial reference memory radial maze task. When we ran a spatial discrimination water maze task using two visually identical beacons, Grin1$\Delta$DGCA1 mice were impaired at using spatial information to inhibit selecting the decoy beacon, despite knowing the platform's actual spatial location. This failure could suffice to impair radial maze performance despite spatial memory itself being normal. Thus, these hippocampal NMDARs are not essential for encoding or storing long-term, associative spatial memories. Instead, we demonstrate an important function of the hippocampus in using spatial knowledge to select between alternative responses that arise from competing or overlapping memories.},

abstract = {Animals use sensory information to move toward more favorable conditions. Drosophila larvae can move up or down gradients of odors (chemotax), light (phototax), and temperature (thermotax) by modulating the probability, direction, and size of turns based on sensory input. Whether larvae can anemotax in gradients of mechanosensory cues is unknown. Further, although many of the sensory neurons that mediate taxis have been described, the central circuits are not well understood. Here, we used high-throughput, quantitative behavioral assays to demonstrate Drosophila larvae anemotax in gradients of wind speeds and to characterize the behavioral strategies involved. We found that larvae modulate the probability, direction, and size of turns to move away from higher wind speeds. This suggests that similar central decision-making mechanisms underlie taxis in somatosensory and other sensory modalities. By silencing the activity of single or very few neuron types in a behavioral screen, we found two sensory (chordotonal and multidendritic class III) and six nerve cord neuron types involved in anemotaxis. We reconstructed the identified neurons in an electron microscopy volume that spans the entire larval nervous system and found they received direct input from the mechanosensory neurons or from each other. In this way, we identified local interneurons and first- and second-order subesophageal zone (SEZ) and brain projection neurons. Finally, silencing a dopaminergic brain neuron type impairs anemotaxis. These findings suggest that anemotaxis involves both nerve cord and brain circuits. The candidate neurons and circuitry identified in our study provide a basis for future detailed mechanistic understanding of the circuit principles of anemotaxis. Jovanic et al. use high-throughput quantitative behavioral analysis, manipulation of neuronal activity, and EM reconstruction of neuronal connectivity to characterize Drosophila larva anemotactic behavior and identify two types of sensory neurons, six nerve cord neurons, and a brain dopaminergic neuron cluster all implicated in anemotaxis.},

abstract = {Gamma-frequency oscillations depend on phasic synaptic GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R)-mediated inhibition to synchronize spike timing. The spillover of synaptically released GABA can also activate extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs, and such tonic inhibition may also contribute to modulating network dynamics. In many neuronal cell types, tonic inhibition is mediated by delta subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs. We found that the frequency of in vitro cholinergically induced gamma oscillations in the mouse hippocampal CA3 region was increased by the activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) on interneurons. The NMDAR-dependent increase of gamma oscillation frequency was counteracted by the tonic inhibition of the interneurons mediated by delta subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs. Recordings of synaptic currents during gamma activity revealed that NMDAR-mediated increases in oscillation frequency correlated with a progressive synchronization of phasic excitation and inhibition in the network. Thus, the balance between tonic excitation and tonic inhibition of interneurons may modulate gamma frequency by shaping interneuronal synchronization.},

abstract = {Clinical pain is a serious public health issue. Treatment of pain-related suffering requires knowledge of how pain signals are initially interpreted and subsequently transmitted and perpetuated. This review article is one of three reviews in this issue of Neuron that address our understanding of the pain process and possible solutions to the problem from both cellular- and systems-level viewpoints. Our understanding of the neural correlates of pain perception in humans has increased significantly since the advent of neuroimaging. Relating neural activity changes to the varied pain experiences has led to an increased awareness of how factors (e.g., cognition, emotion, context, injury) can separately influence pain perception. Tying this body of knowledge in humans to work in animal models of pain provides an opportunity to determine common features that reliably contribute to pain perception and its modulation. One key system that underpins the ability to change pain intensity is the brainstem's descending modulatory network with its pro- and antinociceptive components. We discuss not only the latest data describing the cerebral signature of pain and its modulation in humans, but also suggest that the brainstem plays a pivotal role in gating the degree of nociceptive transmission so that the resultant pain experienced is appropriate for the particular situation of the individual. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {INTRODUCTIONIn the neocortex, elucidating the mechanisms of structural plasticity is essential to an understanding of the emergent network properties and fundamental cognitive phenomena, such as memory formation. Time-lapse imaging microscopy has revealed a remarkable array of dynamic activities in dendritic structures in developing cortical tissue in vitro, the developing cortex in vivo, and even the adult neocortex. Chronic high-resolution in vivo imaging of the structure of neurons in the cortex became possible with the invention of two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM). This technique has key advantages over conventional, single-photon excitation techniques, such as confocal microscopy. Two-photon excitation is the near-simultaneous (within femtoseconds) absorption of two photons coinciding on a fluorophore. The absorption rate depends quadratically on the illumination intensity and is therefore confined to a small volume around the focal point. Scattered excitation light is too weak to generate fluorescence. Thus, the signal is generated exclusively in a tiny focal volume, and all emitted fluorescence photons constitute useful signals. A related advantage is that the longer wavelengths used to generate two-photon excitation penetrate scattering tissue more efficiently than the shorter wavelengths used to generate single-photon excitation of the same fluorophores. The upper layers (1-4) of neocortex are ideal for high-resolution 2PLSM imaging. This protocol describes experimental procedures for in vivo imaging in the neocortex.},

abstract = {Biologists postulate that sexual dimorphism in the brain underlies gender differences in behavior, yet direct evidence for this has been sparse. We identified a male-specific, fruitless (fru)/doublesex (dsx)-coexpressing neuronal cluster, P1, in Drosophila. The artificial induction of a P1 clone in females effectively provokes male-typical behavior in such females even when the other parts of the brain are not masculinized. P1, located in the dorsal posterior brain near the mushroom body, is composed of 20 interneurons, each of which has a primary transversal neurite with extensive ramifications in the bilateral protocerebrum. P1 is fated to die in females through the action of a feminizing protein, DsxF. A masculinizing protein Fru is required in the male brain for correct positioning of the terminals of P1 neurites. Thus, the coordinated actions of two sex determination genes, dsx and fru, confer the unique ability to initiate male-typical sexual behavior on P1 neurons.},

@article{Heinze2018,
abstract = {Continuously monitoring its position in space relative to a goal is one of the most essential tasks for an animal that moves through its environment. Species as diverse as rats, bees, and crabs achieve this by integrating all changes of direction with the distance covered during their foraging trips, a process called path integration. They generate an estimate of their current position relative to a starting point, enabling a straight-line return, following what is known as a home vector. While in theory path integration always leads the animal precisely back home, in the real world noise limits the usefulness of this strategy when operating in isolation. Noise results from stochastic processes in the nervous system and from unreliable sensory information, particularly when obtaining heading estimates. Path integration, during which angular self-motion provides the sole input for encoding heading (idiothetic path integration), results in accumulating errors that render this strategy useless over long distances. In contrast, when using an external compass this limitation is avoided (allothetic path integration). Many navigating insects indeed rely on external compass cues for estimating body orientation, whereas they obtain distance information by integration of steps or optic-flow-based speed signals. In the insect brain, a region called the central complex plays a key role for path integration. Not only does the central complex house a ring-attractor network that encodes head directions, neurons responding to optic flow also converge with this circuit. A neural substrate for integrating direction and distance into a memorized home vector has therefore been proposed in the central complex. We discuss how behavioral data and the theoretical framework of path integration can be aligned with these neural data. Heinze, Narendra and Cheung discuss the fundamental principles of insect path integration behavior and highlight interactions with other navigational strategies using insights from behavioral data, the theoretical underpinnings, and from recent discoveries illuminating the neural control of path integration.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nociceptive sensitization is an increase in pain perception in response to stimulus. Following brief irradiation of Drosophila larvae with UV, nociceptive sensitization occurs in class IV multiple dendritic (mdIV) neurons, which are polymodal sensory nociceptors. Diverse signaling pathways have been identified that mediate nociceptive sensitization in mdIV neurons, including TNF, Hedgehog, BMP, and Tachykinin, yet the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. RESULTS: Here we report that duox heterozygous mutant larvae, which have normal basal nociception, exhibit an attenuated hypersensitivity response to heat and mechanical force following UV irradiation. Employing the ppk-Gal4 line, which is exclusively expressed in mdIV neurons, we further show that silencing duox in mdIV neurons attenuates UV-induced sensitization. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a novel role for duox in nociceptive sensitization of Drosophila larvae, and will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this process in Drosophila sensory neurons.},

Cytoplasmic calcium transients are often accompanied by an increase in the concentration of nuclear calcium, but the functional significance of such spatially distinct calcium signals is unknown. Here we show that gene expression is differentially controlled by nuclear and cytoplasmic calcium signals which enable a single second messenger to generate diverse transcriptional responses. We used nuclear microinjection of a non-diffusible calcium chelator to block increases in nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, calcium concentrations following activation of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. We showed that increases in nuclear calcium concentration control calcium-activated gene expression mediated by the cyclic-AMP-response element (CRE), and demonstrated that the CRE-binding protein CREB can function as a nuclear calcium-responsive transcription factor. A second signalling pathway, activating transcription through the serum-response element (SRE), is triggered by a rise in cytoplasmic calcium and does not require an increase in nuclear calcium.},

After pairing presynaptic stimulations at time t(pre) with evoked postsynaptic spikes at time t(post) under pharmacological blockade of excitation we found, via whole cell recordings, an asymmetrical timing rule for plasticity of the remaining inhibitory responses. Strength of response varied as a function of the time interval Deltat = t(post) - t(pre): for Deltat {\textgreater} 0 inhibitory responses potentiated, peaking at a delay of 10 ms. For Deltat {\textless} 0, the synaptic coupling depressed, again with a maximal effect near 10 ms of delay. We also show that changes in synaptic strength depend on changes in intracellular calcium concentrations and demonstrate that the calcium enters the postsynaptic cell through voltage-gated channels. Using network models, we demonstrate how this novel form of plasticity can sculpt network behavior efficiently and with remarkable flexibility.},

abstract = {Taxis behaviour in Drosophila larva is thought to consist of distinct control mechanisms triggering specific actions. Here, we support a simpler hypothesis: that taxis results from direct sensory modulation of continuous lateral oscillations of the anterior body, sparing the need for 'action selection'. Our analysis of larvae motion reveals a rhythmic, continuous lateral oscillation of the anterior body, encompassing all head-sweeps, small or large, without breaking the oscillatory rhythm. Further, we show that an agent-model that embeds this hypothesis reproduces a surprising number of taxis signatures observed in larvae. Also, by coupling the sensory input to a neural oscillator in continuous time, we show that the mechanism is robust and biologically plausible. The mechanism provides a simple architecture for combining information across modalities, and explaining how learnt associations modulate taxis. We discuss the results in the light of larval neural circuitry and make testable predictions.},

abstract = {Background: Major depression is a common disorder but the pathophysiology is poorly understood. Current hypotheses implicate deficient function of brain serotonin pathways because drugs that selectively increase brain serotonin activity are effective antidepressants. However, there is no direct evidence that lowered serotonin function causes major depression. We aimed to assess whether lowering of brain serotonin activity by depletion of its aminoacid precursor, tryptophan, could provoke a short-term relapse of clinically significant symptoms in women vulnerable to major depressive disorder. Methods: We studied 15 women who had suffered recurrent episodes of major depression but had recovered and were no longer on drug treatment. Patients received two aminoacid mixtures in a double-blind crossover design. One of the mixtures was nutritionally balanced and contained tryptophan and the other was identical except it contained no tryptophan. Participants were scored on the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D) before and 7 h after drinking each mixture. They also completed hourly self-rated measures of mood during this period. Blood samples were also taken at baseline and 7 h for measurement of plasma tryptophan. Findings: The tryptophan-free mixture produced a 75{\%} reduction in plasma tryptophan concentration. After drinking the tryptophan-free mixture, ten of the 15 women experienced temporary but clinically significant depressive symptoms. The mean difference in total HAM-D scores (7 h minus baseline) were significantly higher after the tryptophan-free mixture than after the nutritionally balanced mixture (7.3 vs 0.15 [95{\%} CI 4.5-9.9]; p {\textless} 0.001). No changes in mood were seen after taking the nutritionally balanced mixture. Interpretation: We conclude that rapid lowering of brain serotonin function can precipitate clinical depressive symptoms in well, untreated individuals who are vulnerable to major depressive disorder. The findings support a key role for deficient serotonin function in the aetiology of depression.},

Much research has focused on the mechanism and function of circadian rhythms in constant conditions or in idealized light-dark environments. There have been comparatively few studies into how social pressures, such as work and school schedules, affect human activity rhythms day to day and season to season. To address this issue, we analyzed activity on Twitter in {\textgreater}1,500 US counties throughout the 2012–2013 calendar years in 15-min intervals using geographically tagged tweets representing ≈0.1{\%} of the total population each day. We find that sustained periods of low Twitter activity are correlated with sufficient sleep as measured by conventional surveys. We show that this nighttime lull in Twitter activity is shifted to later times on weekends relative to weekdays, a phenomenon we term "Twitter social jet lag." The magnitude of this social jet lag varies seasonally and geographically—with the West Coast experiencing less Twitter social jet lag compared to the Central and Eastern US—and is correlated with average commuting schedules and disease risk factors such as obesity. Most counties experience the largest amount of Twitter social jet lag in February and the lowest in June or July. We present evidence that these shifts in weekday activity coincide with relaxed social pressures due to local K-12 school holidays and that the direct seasonal effect of altered day length is comparatively weaker.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd. Diabetes-associated nociceptive hypersensitivity affects diabetic patients with hard-to-treat chronic pain. Because multiple tissues are affected by systemic alterations in insul in signaling, the functional locus of insulin signaling in diabetes-associated hypersensitivity remains obscure. Here, we used Drosophila nociception/nociceptive sensitization assays to investigate the role of Insulin receptor (Insulin-like receptor, InR) in nociceptive hypersensitivity. InR mutant larvae exhibited mostly normal baseline thermal nociception (absence of injury) and normal acute thermal hypersensitivity following UV-induced injury. However, their acute thermal hypersensitivity persists and fails to return to baseline, unlike in controls. Remarkably, injury-induced persistent hypersensitivity is also observed in larvae that exhibit either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Cell type-specific genetic analysis indicates that InR function is required in multidendritic sensory neurons including nociceptive class IV neurons. In these same nociceptive sensory neurons, only modest changes in dendritic morphology were observed in the InR RNAi -expressing and diabetic larvae. At the cellular level, InR-deficient nociceptive sensory neurons show elevated calcium responses after injury. Sensory neuron-specific expression of InR rescues the persistent thermal hypersensitivity of InR mutants and constitutive activation of InR in sensory neurons ameliorates the hypersensitivity observed with a type 2-like diabetic state. Our results suggest that a sensory neuron-specific function of InR regulates the persistence of injury-associated hypersensitivity. It is likely that this new system will be an informative genetically tractable model of diabetes-associated hypersensitivity.},

abstract = {Animal species display enormous variation for innate behaviours, but little is known about how this diversity arose. Here, using an unbiased genetic approach, we map a courtship song difference between wild isolates of Drosophila simulans and Drosophila mauritiana to a 966 base pair region within the slowpoke (slo) locus, which encodes a calcium-activated potassium channel. Using the reciprocal hemizygosity test, we confirm that slo is the causal locus and resolve the causal mutation to the evolutionarily recent insertion of a retroelement in a slo intron within D. simulans. Targeted deletion of this retroelement reverts the song phenotype and alters slo splicing. Like many ion channel genes, slo is expressed widely in the nervous system and influences a variety of behaviours; slo-null males sing little song with severely disrupted features. By contrast, the natural variant of slo alters a specific component of courtship song, illustrating that regulatory evolution of a highly pleiotropic ion channel gene can cause modular changes in behaviour.},

abstract = {Despite living in an obesogenic environment, some individuals maintain a thin phenotype compared to the majority who are at risk for weight gain and obesity. Understanding how these different phenotypes regulate energy intake is critical. The objective of this study was to examine the differences in neuronal response to visual food cues in adults recruited as either obesity-resistant (OR) or obesity-prone (OP) based on self-identification, BMI, and personal/family weight history. 25 OR and 28 OP individuals were studied after 4. days of eucaloric energy intake. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed in the fasted and acute fed states (30. min after a test meal) while subjects viewed images of foods of high hedonic value and neutral non-food objects. Measures of appetite using visual analog scales were performed before and every 30. min after the test meal for 3. h. In the fasted state, food as compared to nonfood images elicited significant response in the insula, somatosensory cortex, parietal cortex, and visual cortex in both OR and OP. The acute fed state resulted in significant attenuation of these and other brain areas in the OR but not OP individuals. Furthermore, OP as compared to OR individuals showed greater activation of medial and anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC) in response to the test meal. Adjusting for fat mass did not impact these results. Attenuation of insula/PFC response to food images in the fed state was associated with greater reductions in hunger. These findings suggest that individuals prone to weight gain and obesity have altered neuronal responses to food cues in brain regions known to be important in energy intake regulation. These altered responses may represent an important mechanism contributing to excess energy intake and risk for obesity. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Cell repulsion requires bidirectional trans-endocytosis of clustered Eph–ephrin complexes at cell interfaces, but the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we identified an actin-regulating pathway allowing ephrinB {\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} cells to trans-endocytose EphB receptors from opposing cells. Live imaging revealed Rac-dependent F-actin enrichment at sites of EphB2 internalization, but not during vesicle trafficking. Systematic depletion of Rho family GTPases and their regulatory proteins identified the Rac subfamily and the Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam2 as key components of EphB2 trans-endocytosis, a pathway previously implicated in Eph forward signaling, in which ephrins act as in trans ligands of Eph receptors. However, unlike in Eph signaling, this pathway is not required for uptake of soluble ligands in ephrinB {\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} cells. We also show that this pathway is required for EphB2-stimulated contact repulsion. These results support the existence of a conserved pathway for EphB trans-endocytosis that removes the physical tether between cells, thereby enabling cell repulsion. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The EU has the probably strictest regulations in the world for the presence of GMOs in food and feed. These require the labeling of food and feed where the level of approved GMO exceeds 0.9{\%} of unintentional adventitious presence. For non-approved GMOs the threshold is 'zero' and thus requires that cargoes containing GMOs non-approved GMOs are returned to the port of origin or are destroyed. The process of GMO safety approval is slow and subject to extensive political interference. However outside of Europe, new GMOs are being created, approved and cultivated at a rate exceeding that of EU approvals. Since current methods of cultivation, storage and transport do not permit complete segregation of GMO and non-GMO crops, some co-mingling must be expected. This leads to a peculiar situation where the EU is dependent on imports (particularly soybean for animal feed) from North and South America and yet, legally, must reject these imports since they contain low levels of unauthorized GMOs. Several authorative European reports indicate that this is not a sustainable situation and must result in feed shortages and price increases of meat and poultry. The solution is to either to modify EU regulations or to synchronize GMOs approvals on an international level. The USA has constantly criticized the EU for its unscientific GMO regulations which it says amounts to trade protectionism. Very recently however, the USA has realized that other countries are now producing and cultivating their own GMOs, and that these are not authorized in the USA. The USA is thus proposing to set up its own system of GMO regulations which may bear a close similarity to those in Europe. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Thus, in both the phasing of dark expression and the response to light mPer1 is most similar to the Neurospora clock gene frq. Within the SCN there appears to be localization of the induction phenomenon, consistent with the localization of both light-sensitive and light-insensitive oscillators in this circadian center.},

abstract = {Rod and cone photoreceptors detect light and relay this information through a multisynaptic pathway to the brain by means of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). These retinal outputs support not only pattern vision but also non-image-forming (NIF) functions, which include circadian photoentrainment and pupillary light reflex (PLR). In mammals, NIF functions are mediated by rods, cones and the melanopsin-containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Rod-cone photoreceptors and ipRGCs are complementary in signalling light intensity for NIF functions. The ipRGCs, in addition to being directly photosensitive, also receive synaptic input from rod-cone networks. To determine how the ipRGCs relay rod-cone light information for both image-forming and non-image-forming functions, we genetically ablated ipRGCs in mice. Here we show that animals lacking ipRGCs retain pattern vision but have deficits in both PLR and circadian photoentrainment that are more extensive than those observed in melanopsin knockouts. The defects in PLR and photoentrainment resemble those observed in animals that lack phototransduction in all three photoreceptor classes. These results indicate that light signals for irradiance detection are dissociated from pattern vision at the retinal ganglion cell level, and animals that cannot detect light for NIF functions are still capable of image formation.},

It is not known which SCN neurons are autonomous pacemakers or how they synchronize their daily firing rhythms to coordinate circadian behavior. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and the VIP receptor VPAC(2) (encoded by the gene Vipr2) may mediate rhythms in individual SCN neurons, synchrony between neurons, or both. We found that Vip(-/-) and Vipr2(-/-) mice showed two daily bouts of activity in a skeleton photoperiod and multiple circadian periods in constant darkness. Loss of VIP or VPAC(2) also abolished circadian firing rhythms in approximately half of all SCN neurons and disrupted synchrony between rhythmic neurons. Critically, daily application of a VPAC(2) agonist restored rhythmicity and synchrony to VIP(-/-) SCN neurons, but not to Vipr2(-/-) neurons. We conclude that VIP coordinates daily rhythms in the SCN and behavior by synchronizing a small population of pacemaking neurons and maintaining rhythmicity in a larger subset of neurons.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Current drug treatments for schizophrenia are inadequate for many patients, and despite 5 decades of drug discovery, all of the treatments rely on the same mechanism: dopamine D(2) receptor blockade. Understanding the pathophysiology of the disorder is thus likely to be critical to the rational development of new treatments for schizophrenia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the nature of the dopaminergic dysfunction in schizophrenia using meta-analysis of in vivo studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies from January 1, 1960, to July 1, 2011.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY SELECTION: A total of 44 studies were identified that compared 618 patients with schizophrenia with 606 controls, using positron emission tomography or single-photon emission computed tomography to measure in vivo striatal dopaminergic function.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA EXTRACTION: Demographic, clinical, and imaging variables were extracted from each study, and effect sizes were determined for the measures of dopaminergic function. Studies were grouped into those of presynaptic function and those of dopamine transporter and receptor availability. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the consistency of effects and the effect of clinical and imaging variables.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SYNTHESIS: There was a highly significant elevation (P.{\textless}001) in presynaptic dopaminergic function in schizophrenia with a large effect size (Cohen d=0.79). There was no evidence of alterations in dopamine transporter availability. There was a small elevation in D(2/3) receptor availability (Cohen d=0.26), but this was not evident in drug-naive patients and was influenced by the imaging approach used.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The locus of the largest dopaminergic abnormality in schizophrenia is presynaptic, which affects dopamine synthesis capacity, baseline synaptic dopamine levels, and dopamine release. Current drug treatments, which primarily act at D(2/3) receptors, fail to target these abnormalities. Future drug development should focus on the control of presynaptic dopamine synthesis and release capacity.},

@article{Ungless2001,
abstract = {How do drugs of abuse modify neural circuitry and thereby lead to addictive behaviour? As for many forms of experience-dependent plasticity, modifications in glutamatergic synaptic transmission have been suggested to be particularly important. Evidence of such changes in response to in vivo administration of drugs of abuse is lacking, however. Here we show that a single in vivo exposure to cocaine induces long-term potentiation of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole propionic acid)-receptor-mediated currents at excitatory synapses onto dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area. Potentiation is still observed 5 but not 10 days after cocaine exposure and is blocked when an NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor antagonist is administered with cocaine. Furthermore, long-term potentiation at these synapses is occluded and long-term depression is enhanced by in vivo cocaine exposure. These results show that a prominent form of synaptic plasticity can be elicited by a single in vivo exposure to cocaine and therefore may be involved in the early stages of the development of drug addiction.},

abstract = {Cortical networks are thought to be shaped by experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. Theoretical studies have shown that synaptic plasticity allows a network to store a memory of patterns of activity such that they become attractors of the dynamics of the network. Here we study the properties of the excitatory synaptic connectivity in a network that maximizes the number of stored patterns of activity in a robust fashion. We show that the resulting synaptic connectivity matrix has the following properties: it is sparse, with a large fraction of zero synaptic weights (‘potential' synapses); bidirectionally coupled pairs of neurons are over-represented in comparison to a random network; and bidirectionally connected pairs have stronger synapses on average than unidirectionally connected pairs. All these features reproduce quantitatively available data on connectivity in cortex. This suggests synaptic connectivity in cortex is optimized to store a large number of attractor states in a robust fashion.},

We also address the potential biological effects of THz radiation during its biological applications and propose future prospects for this cutting-edge technology. THz spectroscopy has proven to be an innovative tool for providing new insights into the hydration shell in the solvation dynamics of protein solutions.THz in-line digital holography, THz near-field imaging modality, and THz endoscope prototypes have been utilized to identify abnormal tissues faster and more accurately.Increasing applications of artificial modeling and numerical computation are becoming essential supplements for THz biological effect studies.},

abstract = {Presynaptic Ca2+ channels are crucial elements in neuronal excitation-secretion coupling. In addition to mediating Ca2+ entry to initiate transmitter release, they are thought to interact directly with proteins of the synaptic vesicle docking/fusion machinery. Here we report isoform-specific, stoichiometric interaction of the BI and rbA isoforms of the alpha1A subunit of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels with the presynaptic membrane proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25 in vitro and in rat brain membranes. The BI isoform binds to both proteins, while only interaction with SNAP-25 can be detected in vitro for the rbA isoform. The synaptic protein interaction ("synprint") site involves two adjacent segments of the intracellular loop connecting domains II and III between amino acid residues 722 and 1036 of the BI sequence. This interaction is competitively blocked by the corresponding region of the N-type Ca2+ channel, indicating that these two channels bind to overlapping regions of syntaxin and SNAP-25. Our results provide a molecular basis for a physical link between Ca2+ influx into nerve terminals and subsequent exocytosis of neurotransmitters at synapses that have presynaptic Ca2+ channels containing alpha1A subunits.},

abstract = {Neuregulin-1 (Nrg1)/erbB signaling regulates neuronal development, migration, myelination, and synaptic maintenance. The Nrg1 gene is a schizophrenia susceptibility gene. To understand the contribution of Nrg1 signaling to adult brain structure and behaviors, we studied the regulation of type III Nrg1 expression and evaluated the effect of decreased expression of the type III Nrg1 isoforms. Type III Nrg1 is transcribed by a promoter distinct from those for other Nrg1 isoforms and, in the adult brain, is expressed in the medial prefrontal cortex, ventral hippocampus, and ventral subiculum, regions involved in the regulation of sensorimotor gating and short-term memory. Adult heterozygous mutant mice with a targeted disruption for type III Nrg1 (Nrg1(tm1.1Lwr+/-)) have enlarged lateral ventricles and decreased dendritic spine density on subicular pyramidal neurons. Magnetic resonance imaging of type III Nrg1 heterozygous mice revealed hypofunction in the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampal CA1 and subiculum regions. Type III Nrg1 heterozygous mice also have impaired performance on delayed alternation memory tasks, and deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI). Chronic nicotine treatment eliminated differences in PPI between type III Nrg1 heterozygous mice and their wild-type littermates. Our findings demonstrate a role of type III Nrg1 signaling in the maintenance of corticostriatal components and in the neural circuits involved in sensorimotor gating and short-term memory.},

Combined with reprogramming technology, human somatic cell-derived NSCs and their progeny can model neurological diseases with improved accuracy.
